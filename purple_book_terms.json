Note 3: The degree of crystallinity may be expressed either as the mass fraction, w c , or as the volume fraction, φ c, the two quantities being related by <!-- formula-not-decoded --> where ρ and ρ c are the densities of the entire sample and of the crystalline fraction, respectively. Note 4: The degree of crystallinity can be determined by several experimental techniques; among the most commonly used are: (i) X-ray diffraction, (ii) calorimetry, (iii) density measurements, and (iv) infrared spectroscopy (IR). Imperfections in crystals are not easily distinguished from the amorphous phase. Also, the various techniques may be affected to different extents by imperfections and interfacial effects. Hence, some disagreement among the results of quantitative measurements of crystallinity by different methods is frequently encountered. Note 5: The following expressions for w c, α , are recommended, where the subscript α specifies the particular experimental method used. (i) By X-ray diffraction: the degree of crystallinity, w c,x, is given by <!-- formula-not-decoded --> where I c and I a are the integrated intensities scattered over a suitable angular interval by the crystalline and the amorphous phases, respectively, and K x is a calibration constant. If the sample is anisotropic, a suitable average of the diffracted intensity in reciprocal space must be obtained. (ii) By calorimetry: the degree of crystallinity, w c,h is given by <!-- formula-not-decoded --> where ∆ fus h is the specific enthalpy of fusion of the sample and ∆ fus,c h is the specific enthalpy of fusion of the completely crystalline polymer over the same temperature range.",

They also have the distinctive property of preserving an equal distance between them. Note 3: A focal-conic domain built around an ellipse and an hyperbola is the most common type of defect in thermotropic smectic A phases. The hyperbola passes through a focus of the ellipse and the ellipse passes through the focus of the hyperbola (see Fig. 24).

However, cases exist where, at each propagation step, a low-molar-mass byproduct is formed, as in the polymerization of 1,3-oxazolidine-2,5-diones derived from amino acids (commonly termed amino acid N -carboxyanhydrides). When a low-molarmass by-product is formed, the adjective condensative is recommended to give the term 'condensative chain polymerization'.

Note 6: There exist, exceptionally, some polymerizations that can proceed via chain reactions that, according to the definition, are not chain polymerizations. For example, the polymerization <!-- formula-not-decoded --> proceeds via a radical chain reaction with intermolecular transfer of the radical centre.

Reprinted from Pure Appl. Chem. 74 , 915-922 (2002) Note 1: An asymmetric polymerization generally produces a polymer which contains chirality centres of opposite configuration in unequal amounts. Note 2: Chiral features may be present in monomers, solvents, initiators, catalysts and supports. Note 3: Polymerization is defined as the process of converting a monomer or a mixture of monomers into a polymer [1]. Thus the definition of an asymmetric polymerization covers homopolymerization and copolymerization. Note 4: Some stereospecific polymerizations produce tactic polymers [3] that contain a mixture of pairs of enantiomeric polymer molecules in equal amounts. For example, in the case of a polymerization leading to an isotactic polymer the product consists of <!-- formula-not-decoded --> and their corresponding enantiomers <!-- formula-not-decoded --> in equal amounts; here, -R- and -S- represent enantiomeric configurational repeating units. The product can be considered to be a mixture of polymer racemates because a racemate is defined as an equimolar mixture of enantiomers [4]. Such polymerizations can be named by using the adjective 'racemate-forming', as in 'racemate-forming chirogenic polymerization' (see Note 4 to Definition 2) and 'racemate-forming enantiomerdifferentiating polymerization' (see Note 2 to Definition 3). Polymerizations of prochiral substituted ethenes leading to atactic polymers usually give enantiomeric polymer molecules in equal amounts. However, use of the adjective 'racemate-forming' is discouraged for such cases where a mixture of polymer racemates molecules with the same degree of polymerization consists of a large number of diastereomers.",

    "term": "asymmetric chirogenic polymerization",
    "definition": "Asymmetric polymerization in which the polymer molecules formed contain one (or more) new type(s) of elements of chirality not existing in the starting monomer(s). Note 1: The new elements of chirality generated in the course of the polymerization may be new types of chirality centres in the polymer molecules (see Notes 2, 4, and 5 to Definition 2) or may arise from the helicity of the polymer molecules (see Note 3 to Definition 2). Note 2: In asymmetric chirogenic polymerizations of some prochiral monomers, such as Examples 2.1 and 2.2, at least one new type of chirality centre in the main chain is generated at each propagation step, which lead to polymer molecules having the same configuration ( R or S ) at each corresponding chirality centre. The resulting polymer is isotactic and optically active. Note 3: Some asymmetric chirogenic polymerizations give helical polymer molecules of only one screw sense that usually show optical activity due to the helicity (see Examples 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7). These polymerizations are termed 'asymmetric helix-chirogenic polymerizations'. Note 4: Some polymerizations produce enantiomeric polymer molecules in equal amounts; each polymer molecule contains, in its main chain, a single type of chirality centre that does not exist in the starting monomer. The resulting polymer is optically inactive, and the polymerization is not an asymmetric chirogenic polymerization. Such a polymerization is termed a 'racemate-forming chirogenic polymerization'. The polymerizations described in Examples 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7, carried out using an optically inactive initiator of the corresponding racemate, are examples of racemate-forming chirogenic polymerizations. Another example is the polymerization of penta-1,3-diene with an optically inactive initiator of the corresponding racemate (see Example 2.1), which leads to an isotactic product. Note 5: In some polymerizations of vinyl monomers leading to isotactic polymers using an optically active initiator, stereorepeating units [3] of one type of chirality centre are formed at every propagation step. Hence, they give only one type of enantiomeric polymer molecule (A or B), and are asymmetric chirogenic polymerizations. Optical activities of the resulting isotactic polymers are usually very small or not detectable, because the polymer molecules can be regarded as having a plane of symmetry if their degrees of polymerization are so large that the presence of their end-groups is negligible. <!-- image --> In usual polymerizations of vinyl monomers leading to isotactic polymers, the enantiomeric polymer molecules (A) and (B) are formed in equal amounts, and the polymerizations are not asymmetric but racemate-forming chirogenic polymerizations.",

The torsion angle is written in full as θ (A i , B j , C k , D l ,), which may be abbreviated, if there is no ambiguity, to θ (B j , C k ), θ (B j ) or θ j B , etc. In the eclipsed conformation in which the projections of A-B and C-D coincide, θ is given the value 0° (synperiplanar conformation). A torsion angle is considered positive (+ θ ) or negative (-θ ) depending on whether, when the system is viewed along the central bond in the direction B-C (or C-B), the bond to the front atom A (or D) requires the smaller angle of rotation to the right or to the left, respectively, in order that it may eclipse the bond to the rear atom D (or A); note that it is immaterial whether the system be viewed from one end or the other. According to this definition, a sequence of consecutive positive torsion angles generates a right-handed helix (Helix sense, p. 43). It is to be noted that: 1. torsion angles are measured in the range -180° &lt; θ &lt; + 180° rather than from 0° to 360°, so that the relationship between enantiomeric configurations or conformations can be readily appreciated; 2. any Greek letter from the end of the alphabet, except τ, can be used to denote torsion angles; θ or ω of are recommended; 3. abbreviated notations are preferably restricted to bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles related to main-chain atoms. Conformations referring to torsion angles θ (A, B, C, D), where A, B, C, D are main-chain atoms, can be described as: cis or synperiplanar (C); gauche or synclinal (G); anticlinal (A); and trans or antiperiplanar (T), corresponding to torsion angles within ±30° of, respectively, 0°, ±60°, ± 120° and ± 180°. The letters shown in parentheses (upper case C, G, A, T) are the recommended abbreviations. * The symbols G + , G -(or A + , A -, for example) refer to torsion angles of similar type but opposite known sign, i.e., ~ + 60°, ~ - 60° (or ~ + 120°, ~ -120°). The notation G, G; A, A; (and T, T ; C, C whenever the torsion angles are not exactly equal to 180º and 0º respectively) is reserved for the designation of enantiomorph conformations, i.e., conformations of opposite but unspecified sign. Where necessary, a deviation from the proper value of the torsion angle can be indicated by the sign (~), as in the following examples: G(~); G(~); G + (~); G -(~).",
