## PREAMBLE

A  report  entitled  'Nomenclature  Dealing  with  Steric  Regularity  in  High  Polymers'  was issued in 1962 by the Committee on Nomenclature of the Commission on Macromolecules of the IUPAC [1]. Since then, the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques for structure determination has greatly enlarged the field of polymer stereochemistry and this, in  turn,  has  revealed  the  need  for  a  detailed  knowledge  of  molecular  conformations  in order  to  correlate  chemical  structure  with  physical  properties.  The  terminology  and nomenclature  relating  to  the  constitution  and  configuration  of  macromolecules  has  been refined, using structure-based concepts, in documents of this Commission [2,3], while an IUPAC  paper  [4]  on  the  graphical  representation  of  stereochemical  configuration  of organic molecules and an IUPAC-IUB document [5] on abbreviations and symbols to be used  for  the  description  of  the  conformations  of  polypeptide  chains  have  appeared  as definitive  publications.  The  present  statement  is  intended  to  bring up  to date the nomenclature  of  features  corresponding  to  stereoregularity  in  polymers;  it  employs  the definitions prescribed in [2] and takes into account all the previously elaborated material cited  above;  it  also  introduces  new  concepts  dealing  with  the  microstructure  of  polymer chains,  and  it  proposes  a  set  of  definitions  and  notations  for  the  description  of  the conformations  of  polymer  molecules.  Consistency  with  documents  [4]  and  [5]  has  been maintained as far as is possible.

Throughout this document, stereochemical formulae for polymer chains are shown as Fischer projections rotated through 90°, i.e., displayed horizontally rather than vertically, (at variance with [1]) or as hypothetical extended zigzag chains.

The use of rotated Fischer projections corresponds to the practice of using horizontal lines to denote polymer backbone bonds, but it is most important to note that this does not give an immediately visual impression of the zigzag chain. In the projections as used in this  document, at  each  individual  backbone  carbon  atom the  horizontal  lines  represent bonds directed below the plane of the paper from the carbon atom while the vertical lines project  above  the  plane  of  the  paper  from  the  carbon  atom.  Thus,  the  rotated  Fischer projection

The use of rotated Fischer projections has been retained in the present edition in order to  provide  a  link  with,  and  an  explanation  of,  the  bulk  of  existing  published  polymer literature,  although  the  present  common  practice  [4]  is  to  depict  main-chain  bonds  in planar, extended zigzag ( all -trans ) conformations, together with a stereochemical representation of side-groups at tetrahedrally-bonded atoms.

Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  drawings  of  configurational  base  units,  configurational repeating units, stereorepeating units, etc., provide information regarding relative configurations.

In a polymer  molecule, the two  portions of the main  chain attached to any constitutional  unit  are,  in  general,  non-identical;  consequently,  a  backbone  carbon  atom that also bears two different side-groups is considered to be a chiral centre.

The absence from a formula of any one of the horizontal or vertical lines at a chiral or prochiral carbon atom (as in examples on pages 27 and 32), or of E or Z designations ∗ at double bonds, indicates that the configuration of that stereoisomeric centre is not known. Also, as in our previous document [2], the convention of orienting polymer structures (and the corresponding constitutional and configurational units) from left to right is used. Thus, the two bracketted constitutional units in

<!-- image -->

are regarded as different, even though the repetition of either one of them would give the same regular polymer. Some of the definitions presented also appear in a previous paper of this Commission [2], but they are repeated here (with minor grammatical improvement) in order to provide a complete set of stereochemical definitions in a single document.

In order to present clear concepts it is necessary that idealized definitions be adopted but it  is  recognized  that  the  realities  of  polymer  science  must  be  faced.  Deviations  from ideality arise with polymers at both molecular and bulk levels in ways that have no parallel with  the  ordinary  small  molecules  of  organic  or  inorganic  chemistry.  Although  such deviations are not explicitly taken into account in the definitions below, the nomenclature recommended  can  usefully  be  applied  to  the  predominant  structural  features  of  real polymer molecules, if necessary with self-explanatory, if imprecise, qualifications such as 'almost completely isotactic' or 'highly syndiotactic'. Although such expressions lack the rigour beloved by the purist, every experienced polymer scientist knows that communication in this discipline is impossible without them.

∗ With regard to the arrangement of substituents at double bonds (double-bond configuration), it is recommended that E and Z stereodescriptors rather than cis and trans stereodescriptors be used throughout.

## 1 BASIC DEFINITIONS

## 1.1 configurational unit

Constitutional unit having one or more sites of defined stereoisomerism.

## 1.2 configurational base unit

Constitutional repeating unit in a regular macromolecule, a regular oligomer molecule, a regular block, or a regular chain, the configuration of which is defined at least at one site of stereoisomerism in the main chain.

Note: In a regular polymer, a configurational base unit corresponds to the constitutional repeating unit.

## 1.3 configurational repeating unit

Smallest  set  of  successive configurational  base  units that  prescribes  configurational repetition  at  one  or  more  sites  of  stereoisomerism  in  the  main  chain  of  a  regular macromolecule, a regular oligomer molecule, a regular block, or a regular chain.

## 1.4 stereorepeating unit

Configurational repeating unit having defined configurations at all sites of stereoisomerism  in  the  main  chain  of  a  regular  macromolecule,  a  regular  oligomer molecule, a regular block, or a regular chain.

Note:  Two configurational  units that  correspond  to  the  same  constitutional  unit  are considered  to  be enantiomeric if  they  are  non-superposable  mirror  images.  Two  nonsuperposable configurational  units that  correspond  to  the  same  constitutional  unit  are considered to be diastereomeric if they are not mirror images.

## Examples :

In the regular polymer molecule \_\_ [ CH(CH3)-CH2 ] n \_\_\_ , polypropene, the constitutional repeating unit is -CH(CH3)-CH2and the corresponding configurational base units are

<!-- image -->

The configurational base units (1) and (2) are enantiomeric, while the configurational units (1)  and  (3)  cannot  be  enantiomeric  because  the  constitutional  units  are  different species, according to this nomenclature.

<!-- image -->

It  is  immaterial  whether  (1)  or  (2)  is  taken  as  the configurational repeating unit and stercorepeating unit of isotactic polypropene (see Definition 1.7); this is so because the two infinite chains, one built up of identical configurational units (1) and the other built up of

identical configurational  units (2),  are not enantiomeric  and  differ  only  in  the  chain orientation. Within each pair of units,

<!-- image -->

CH3

the  components  are  enantiomeric  since  they  are  non-superposable  mirror  images,  as defined  above.  However,  with  the  constitutional  unit  -CHR-CHR ' -CH2-CH2-,  the  two corresponding configurational units

<!-- image -->

are diastereomeric. The units

<!-- image -->

are enantiomeric. The units

<!-- image -->

are not enantiomeric, but diastereomeric. The simplest possible stereorepeating units in a stereoregular polypropene are

<!-- image -->

and the corresponding stereoregular polymers are

## 1.5 tactic polymer

Regular  polymer,  the  molecules  of  which  have  essentially  all  identical configurational repeating units .

## 1.6 tacticity

Orderliness  of  the  succession  of configurational  repeating  units in  the main  chain of  a regular macromolecule , a regular oligomer molecule , a regular block , or a regular chain .. Note: For the definition of degree of tacticity , see Section 4.

## 1.7 isotactic polymer

Regular polymer, comprising tactic macromolecules having essentially only one species of configurational base unit which has chiral or prochiral atoms in the main chain in a unique arrangement with respect to its adjacent constitutional units.

Note 1: In an isotactic polymer, the configurational repeating unit is identical with the configurational base unit .

Note 2: An isotactic polymer consists of meso diads.

## 1.8 syndiotactic polymer

Regular polymer, comprising tactic macromolecules having alternating enantiomeric configurational base units , which have chiral or prochiral atoms in the main chain in a unique arrangement with respect to their adjacent constitutional units.

Note 1: In a syndiotactic macromolecule, the configurational repeating unit consists of two configurational base units that are enantiomeric.

Note 2: A syndiotactic macromolecule consists of racemo diads.

## 1.9 stereoregular polymer

Regular  polymer,  the  molecules  of  which  essentially  comprise  only  one  species  of stereorepeating unit

## 1.10 atactic polymer

Regular polymer, the molecules of which have equal numbers of the possible configurational base units in a random sequence distribution.

## Examples :

For  the  polymer \_\_ [ CH(COOR)CH(CH3) ] n \_\_\_ , if  only  the  ester-bearing  main-chain  site  in each constitutional repeating unit has defined stereochemistry, the configurational repeating unit is (7) and the corresponding isotactic polymer is (8).

<!-- image -->

In the corresponding syndiotactic case, the configurational repeating unit is (9) and the syndiotactic polymer is (10):

<!-- image -->

As the definition of a stereoregular polymer (see Definitions 1.4 and 1.9) requires that the configuration be defined at all sites of stereoisomerism, structures (8) and (10) do not represent stereoregular polymers . The same is true of (11) and (12), which differ from (8) and (10) in that the sites of specified and unspecified configuration have been interchanged.

<!-- image -->

Examples  (4),  (5),  (6),  (8),  (10),  (11)  and  (12)  are tactic  polymers .  A stereoregular polymer is  always  a tactic  polymer ,  but  a tactic  polymer is  not  always  stereoregular because a tactic polymer need not have all sites of stereoisomerism defined.

Further examples of tactic polymers are:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

syndiotactic poly(methylmethylene)

Note:  Structure-based  names  of tactic  polymers are  formed  before  the  application  of adjectives designating tacticity ; thus, 'syndiotactic poly(methylmethylene)' is preferred to 'syndiotactic poly(1,2-dimethylethane-1,2-diyl)' because a shorter repeating unit is identified, in conformity with the rules in Ref. 3.

## On atactic polymers:

Note: As the definition above indicates, a regular polymer, the configurational base units of which contain one site of stereoisomerism only, is atactic if it has equal numbers of the possible  types  of configurational  base  units arranged  in  a  random  distribution.  If  the constitutional repeating unit contains more than one site of stereoisomerism, the polymer may  be  atactic  with  respect  to  only  one  type  of  site  if  there  are  equal  numbers  of  the possible configurations of that site arranged in a random distribution.

## Examples :

constitutional repeating unit

configurational base units (randomly distributed in an atactic polymer )

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

A  polymer  such  as \_\_ [ CH=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2 ] n \_\_\_ ,  which  has  two  main-chain  sites  of stereoisomerism, may be atactic with respect to the double bond only, with respect to the chiral atom only or with respect to both centres of stereoisomerism. If there is a random distribution  of  equal  numbers  of  units  in  which  the  double  bond  is cis and trans ,  the polymer is atactic with respect to the double bond, and if there is a random distribution of equal numbers of units containing the chiral atom in the two possible configurations, the polymer is atactic with respect to the chiral atom. The polymer is completely atactic when it  contains,  in  a  random  distribution,  equal  numbers  of  the  four  possible configurational base units which have defined stereochemistry at both sites of stereoisomerism.

In addition to isotactic, syndiotactic and atactic polymer s (and other well-defined types of tactic  polymers ),  there  exists  the  whole  range  of  possible  arrangements  between  the completely ordered and the completely random distributions of configurational base units ,

and it is necessary to employ the concept of degree of tacticity (see Section 4) to describe such systems.

## 1.11 stereospecific polymerization

Polymerization  in  which  a tactic  polymer is  formed.  However,  polymerization  in  which stereoisomerism  present  in  the  monomer  is  merely  retained  in  the  polymer  is  not  to  be regarded as stereospecific. For example, the polymerization of a chiral monomer, e.g., ( R )-propylene oxide (( R )-methyloxirane), with retention of configuration is not considered to be a stereospecific reaction; however, selective polymerization, with retention, of one of the  enantiomers  present  in  a  mixture  of  ( R )-  and  ( S )-propylene  oxide  molecules  is  so classified.

## 1.12 ditactic polymer

Tactic polymer that contains two sites of defined stereoisomerism in the main chain of the configurational base unit .

## Examples :

<!-- image -->

are both ditactic.

## 1.13 tritactic polymer

Tactic polymer that contains three sites of defined stereoisomerism in the main chain of the configurational base unit .

## Example :

<!-- image -->

poly[( Z )-(3S)-3-(methoxycarbonyl)-(4S)-4-methylbut-1-ene-1,4-diyl]

## 1.14 diisotactic polymer

Isotactic polymer that contains two chiral or prochiral atoms with defined stereochemistry in the main chain of the configurational base unit .

n

## 1.15 disyndiotactic polymer

Syndiotactic polymer that contains two chiral or prochiral atoms with defined stereochemistry in the main chain of the configurational base unit .

Examples :

<!-- image -->

A polymer with the repeating unit

<!-- image -->

is ditactic and may be described as syndiotactic (see Definition 1.8), but it is not disyndiotactic.

The relative configuration of adjacent, constitutionally non-equivalent, carbon atoms can be specified as erythro or threo, as appropriate, by adding the required prefix to the terms 'diisotactic' and 'disyndiotactic', as necessary (see Section 2.2).

## 1.16 cistactic polymer

Tactic polymer in which the main-chain double bonds of the configurational base units are entirely in the Z configuration.

## 1.17 transtactic polymer

Tactic polymer in which the main-chain double bonds of the configurational base units are entirely in the E configuration.

Note  1:  Terms  referring  to  the tacticity of  polymers  (tactic,  ditactic,  tritactic,  isotactic, cistactic, etc.) can  also be applied with similar significance to chains, sequences, blocks, etc.

<!-- image -->

does not represent a different disyndiotactic polymer.

Note 2: Terms defining stereochemical arrangements are to be italicized only when they form  part  of  the  name  of  a  polymer;  the  use  of  such  terms  as  adjectives,  even  when immediately preceding names, does not require italics.  This  practice  is  illustrated  in  the examples below.

## Examples :

isotactic poly[( E )-3-methylbut-1-ene-1,4-diyl]; transisotactic poly(3-methylbut-1-ene-1,4-diyl) ∗

<!-- image -->

## 1.18 block

Portion  of  a macromolecule ,  comprising  many constitutional  units ,  that  has  at  least  one constitutional or configurational feature which is not present in the adjacent portions.

## 1.19 tactic block

Regular block that can be described by only one species of configurational repeating unit in a single sequential arrangement.

## 1.20 atactic block

Regular  block  that  has  equal  numbers  of  the  possible configurational  base  units in  a random sequence distribution.

## 1.21 stereoblock

Regular  block  that  can  be  described  by  one  species  of  stereorepeating  unit  in  a  single sequential arrangement.

## 1.22 tactic block polymer

Polymer, the molecules of which consist of tactic blocks connected linearly.

∗ Structure-based name; either may be used.

## 1.23 stereoblock polymer

Polymer,  the  molecules  of  which  consist  of  stereoblocks,  and  possibly  some  nonstereoregular blocks.

## Examples :

where and are, for example,

Tactic block polymer -A k -B l -A m -B n -A B

<!-- image -->

In this case the blocks are stereoblocks but the block polymer is not a block copolymer because all the units derive from a single monomer.

In the folowing example of a regular polypropene chain, the stereoblocks are denoted by |\_\_\_\_\_| . Here, the sequence of identical relative configurations of adjacent units that characterizes the stereoblock is terminated at each end of the block. Note that represents  a configurational  sequence ,  which  may  or  may  not  be  identical  with  a stereoblock.

<!-- image -->

The configurational  sequence and stereosequence coincide  in  this  particular  case because  there  is  only  one  site  of  stereoisomerism  in  each  constitutional  repeating  unit (compare Definitions 2.1.3 and 2.1.4).

## 2 SEQUENCES

## 2.1 Constitutional and Configurational Sequences

Descriptions  of  polymer  structures  revealed  by  studies  of  physical  properties  focus attention  on  the  distribution  of  local  arrangements  present  in  the  molecules,  and  terms useful  in  this  context  are  defined  in  this  section.  (The  terms  defined  here  in  relation  to complete polymer molecules can also be applied to sequences and to blocks, as in Ref. 2, Definition 3.14.)

## 2.1.1 constitutional sequence

Whole  or  part  of  a  chain  comprising  one  or  more  species  of  constitutional  unit(s)  in defined sequence.

Example :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note: Constitutional sequences comprising two constitutional units are termed diads, those comprising  three  constitutional  units  triads,  and  so  on.  In  order  of  increasing  sequence lengths they are called tetrads, pentads, hexads, heptads, octads, nonads, decads, undecads, etc.

## 2.1.2 constitutional homosequence

Constitutional sequence which contains constitutional units of only one species and in one sequential arrangement.

Example :

<!-- image -->

In these two cases, the constitutional unit -CH(CH3)-CH2can be called the constitutional repeating unit of the homosequence.

## 2.1.3 configurational sequence

Whole  or  part  of  a  chain  comprising  one  or  more  species  of configurational  unit(s) in defined sequence.

Note  1: See examples following Definition 1.23.

Note  2: Configurational sequences comprising two configurational units are termed diads, those  with  three  such  configurational  units  triads,  and  so  on.  In  order  of  increasing sequence lengths they are called tetrads, pentads, hexads, heptads, octads, nonads, decads, undecads, etc.

## 2.1.4 stereosequence

Configurational sequence in  which the relative or absolute configuration is defined at all sites of stereoisomerism in the main chain of a polymer molecule.

## 2.1.5 configurational homosequence

Constitutional homosequence in which the relative or absolute configuration is defined at one  or  more  sites  of  stereoisomerism  in  each  constitutional  unit  in  the  main  chain  of  a polymer molecule.

## 2.1.6 stereohomosequence

Configurational homosequence in which the relative or absolute configuration is defined at all sites of stereoisomerism in the main chain of a polymer molecule.

## 2.2 Description of Relative Configurations

erythro and threo structures

Relative configurations at two contiguous carbon atoms in main chains bearing, respectively,  substituents  a  and  b  (a  ≠  b),  are  designated  by  the  prefix erythro  or  threo, as appropriate, by analogy with the terminology for carbohydrate systems [6]  in  which the substituents are -OH.

Examples :

<!-- image -->

Similar systems  in which  a  higher level of substitution exists may  be  treated analogously  if  the erythro or threo designation  is  employed  to  denote  the  relative placements  of  those  two  substituents,  one  for  each  backbone  carbon  atom,  which  rank highest according to the Sequence Rule. Thus, the following hypothetical examples would be designated as indicated:

Examples :

<!-- image -->

This novel extension of the erythro / threo terminology, especially its conjunction with the Sequence  Rule,  is  specifically  proposed  solely  to  cope  with  the  problems  incurred  in describing the steric structures of macromolecules.

## meso and racemo structures

Relative  configurations  of  consecutive,  but  not  necessarily  contiguous,  constitutionally equivalent carbon atoms that have a symmetrically constituted connecting group (if any) are designated as meso or racemo , as appropriate.

a

<!-- image -->

(The symbol - / \/\/ \ - represents a symmetrically constituted connecting group, such as -CH2-, -CH2-CH2-, or -CR2-CH2-CR2-.)

## Note: The structures

both have the meso relative configuration but the boldly printed carbon atoms in each of the formulae below cannot be considered as in a meso arrangement because the connecting group lacks the necessary symmetry.

The term ' racemo '  is  introduced  here  as  the  logical  prefix  for  the  designation  of  an arrangement that is analogous to racemic, in the sense defined above. It is unfortunate that the meaning of the term 'racemic' current in organic chemistry is not directly applicable to polymers,  but  the  use  of  the  prefix  ' racemo '  proposed  here  should  not  cause  confusion because  of  the  special  context.  To  achieve  a  full  configurational  description,  it  may  be necessary to preface the name of a polymer with a compound adjective that combines a term  such  as erythro , threo , meso or racemo with  a  term  such  as  'diisotactic'  or 'disyndiotactic'.

## Examples:

<!-- image -->

## TERMINOLOGY

<!-- image -->

Polymers  with  chiral  centres  arising  from  rings  linking  adjacent  main-chain  carbon atoms can be included in this nomenclature:

threo diisotactic polymer

<!-- image -->

In the last two cases, the chiralities of the asymmetric centres should be designated R -or S -, if known.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

If the rings are symmetrical:

<!-- image -->

## Stereosequences

Stereosequences terminating in tetrahedral stereoisomeric centres at both ends, and which comprise two, three, four, five, etc., consecutive centres of that type, may be called diads, triads, tetrads, pentads, etc., respectively.

Typical diads are:

<!-- image -->

When it is necessary to specify the internal stereochemistry of the group, a prefix is required. In vinyl polymers there are meso (m) and racemic (r) diads and mm, mr, rr triads. The latter may be called isotactic, heterotactic and syndiotactic triads, respectively. Stereoregular vinyl polymers can be defined in terms of the regular sequences of diads; thus an isotactic vinyl polymer consists entirely of m diads, i.e., it corresponds to the following succession of relative configuration -mmmmmm-, whereas a syndiotactic vinyl polymer consists entirely of r diads, corresponding to the sequence -rrrrrrr-. Similarly, a vinyl polymer consisting entirely of mr (= rm ) triads is called a heterotactic polymer.

## 3 CONFORMATIONS

## 3.1 Designation of conformation of polymer molecules

## Bond lengths

If  a  specific  A-B  bond  is  denoted  as  A i -B j ,  the  bond  length  is  written b (A i ,  B j ). Abbreviated notations, such as bi , may be used if this meaning is clarified by a diagram.

## Bond angles

The bond angle formed by three consecutive atoms

<!-- image -->

i

is written τ (A i , B j , C k ) which may be abbreviated, if there is no ambiguity, to τ (B j ), τ j B , τ B( j ), or τ j .

## Torsion angles

If a system of four consecutive atoms

D

<!-- image -->

is  projected onto a plane normal to bond B-C, the angle between the projection of A-B and the projection of C-D is described as the torsion angle of A and D about bond B-C; this angle may also be described as the angle between the plane containing A, B and C and the plane containing B, C and D. The torsion angle is written in full as θ (A i , B j , C k , D l ,), which may be abbreviated, if there is no ambiguity, to θ (B j , C k ), θ (B j ) or θ j B , etc. In the eclipsed conformation in which the projections of A-B and C-D coincide, θ is given the value  0°  (synperiplanar  conformation).  A  torsion  angle  is  considered  positive (+ θ ) or negative (-θ ) depending on whether, when the system is viewed along the central bond in the direction B-C (or C-B), the bond to the front atom A (or D) requires the smaller angle of rotation to the right or to the left, respectively, in order that it may eclipse the bond to the rear atom D (or A); note that it is immaterial whether the system be viewed from one end or the other. According to this definition, a sequence of consecutive positive torsion angles generates a right-handed helix (Helix sense, p. 43). It is to be noted that:

1. torsion angles are measured in the range -180° &lt; θ &lt; + 180° rather than from 0° to 360°,  so  that  the  relationship  between  enantiomeric  configurations  or  conformations can be readily appreciated;
2. any Greek letter from the end of the alphabet, except τ, can be used to denote torsion angles; θ or ω of are recommended;
3. abbreviated notations are preferably restricted to bond lengths, bond angles and torsion angles related to main-chain atoms.

Conformations  referring  to  torsion  angles θ (A,  B,  C,  D),  where  A,  B,  C,  D  are main-chain atoms, can be described as: cis or synperiplanar (C); gauche or synclinal (G); anticlinal (A); and trans or antiperiplanar (T), corresponding to torsion angles within ±30° of, respectively, 0°, ±60°, ± 120° and ± 180°. The letters shown in parentheses (upper case C, G, A, T) are the recommended abbreviations. *

The symbols G + ,  G -(or  A + ,  A -,  for  example)  refer  to  torsion  angles  of  similar  type  but opposite known  sign, i.e., ~ + 60°, ~ - 60° (or ~ + 120°, ~ -120°). The notation G,   G; A, A;  (and  T,  T ;  C,  C   whenever  the  torsion  angles  are  not  exactly  equal  to  180º  and  0º respectively) is reserved for the designation of enantiomorph conformations, i.e., conformations  of  opposite  but  unspecified  sign.  Where  necessary,  a  deviation  from  the proper  value  of  the  torsion  angle  can  be  indicated  by  the  sign  (~),  as  in  the  following examples: G(~);   G(~); G + (~); G -(~).

## Examples :

The chain conformation of isotactic polypropene in the crystalline state is: ... TGTGTGTG ...

* Different authors variously use upper and lower case letters in this context. The desire for uniformity necessitates an arbitrary choice between the alternatives, and the upper case has been selected in the belief that it conflicts less with other designations, for example, the use of c and t in Section 3.2

The chain conformation of syndiotactic polypropene in the crystalline state is:

... TTGGTTGG ... or ... TTTTTTTT ...

The chain conformation of a right-handed α -helix is:

- ... G -G -( trans ) G -G -( trans ) ...

or ... G -(~)G -(~)( trans )G -(~)G -(~)( trans ) ...

The cis and trans notation may be used to designate rigid dihedral angles such as those occurring with double bonds.

The chain conformation of crystalline poly(1,1-difluoroethene), modification 2, is: ... TGTGTGT ...

The chain conformation of crystalline poly[( Z )-1-methylbut-1-ene-1,4-diyl] in the α -form is:

- ... ( trans ) CTA( trans ) CTA   ...

The chain conformation of isotactic vinyl polymers in the crystalline state is: ... T(~)G(~)T(~)G(~) ...

A possible conformation of isotactic polypropene in the melt can be described as:

## 3.2 Specific terminology for crystalline polymers

The  crystallographic  identity  period  parallel  to  the  chain  axis  should  preferably  be designated c in descriptions of macromolecular crystallography.

In  the  description  of  helices,  the  following  parameters  and  symbols  should  be employed: n signifies the  number  of  conformational  repeating  units  per  turn  (the conformational  repeating  unit  in  a  crystalline  polymer  is  the  smallest  unit  of  given conformation that is repeated through symmetry operations which comprise a translation. In  most  cases  it  corresponds  to  the configurational  repeating  unit ); h signifies  the  unit height, i.e., the translation along the helix axis per conformational repeating unit; t signifies the unit twist, i.e., the angle of rotation about the helix axis per conformational repeating unit.

## Examples :

If  the  number of conformational repeating units along the identity period c is M and the number of turns is N, then:

n = M/N

h = c/M

t = 2πΝ /M

For isotactic polypropene, since M = 3 , N = 1 and c = 6.50 Å,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

t = 2 π /3

For poly(oxymethylene), since M = 9 , N = 5 and c = 17.39 Å,

## TERMINOLOGY

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## Helix sense

The right-handed sense of a helix traces out a clockwise rotation moving away from the observer; the left-handed sense of a helix traces out an anticlockwise rotation moving away from the observer, e.g., the ...TG + TG + TG + ... helix of isotactic polypropene is left-handed.

## Isomorphous and enantiomorphous structures

In the crystalline state, polymer  chains  are generally parallel to one another but neighbouring chains of equivalent conformation may differ in chirality and/or orientation.

Chains  of  identical  chirality  and  conformation  are isomorphous. Chains  of  opposite chirality but equivalent conformation are enantiomorphous.

## Examples :

Two ...TG + TG + TG + ... helices of isotactic polypropene are isomorphous.

Isotactic  polypropene  chains  of  the  ...TG + TG + TG + ...  and  ...G -TG TG T...  types  are mutually enantiomorphous.

## Isoclined and anticlined structures

With regard to orientation, consider a repeating side-group originating at atom   A i 1 , the first atom of the side-group being   B i α .  For  certain  chain  symmetries  (helical,  for  instance)  the bond vectors

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

have the same components (positive or negative) r

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

along the c axis for every i .

Two equivalent (isomorphous or enantiomorphous) chains in the crystal lattice, having identical components of the bond vectors along c, both positive or both negative, are designated isoclined ; two equivalent chains having bond vectors along c of the same magnitude but opposite sign are designated anticlined .

## E x am p les :

1. Isotactic p oly[( Z )-3-methyl b ut-1-ene-1,4-diyl]

Isoclined isomor p hous chains: the two chains have p arallel axes and the same orientation of the p endant methyl grou p s.

Anticlined isomor p hous chains: the two chains have p arallel axes and o pp osite orientation of the p endant methyl grou p s.

## 2. Isotactic p oly p ro p ene

Anticlined enantiornor p hous chains: the conformation of A corres p onds to a (TG -) n , b ond succession (right-handed helix). The conformation of B corres p onds to a (G + T) n . b ond succession (left-handed helix).

## Line re p etition g rou p s and s y mmetr y elements

To designate linear chain conformations in the crystalline state, the use of line re p etition grou p s [7] is recommended.

[In this case of screw re p etition, the num b er of conformational re p eating residues p er turn is included in p arentheses, i.e.: s(11/3) or s(3.67 + 0.02).]

Second and further sym b ols. The symmetry elements required to define the line re p etition grou p are suggested in Reference [8]. Possi b le symmetry elements are:

- i centre of symmetry
- m p lane of symmetry p er p endicular to the chain axis
- c glide p lane p arallel to the chain axis
- d p lane of symmetry p arallel to the chain axis
- 2   two-fold axis of symmetry p er p endicular to the chain axis

The p ossi b le line re p etition grou p s are listed b elow, with exam p les. (The structureb ased name is given first, the sourceb ased name second, in each case.)

## 4 SUPPLEMENTARY DEFINITIONS

## 4.1 degrees of triad isotacticity, syndiotacticity and heterotacticity

Fractions of triads in a regular vinyl polymer that are of the mm , rr and mr = rm types, respectively.

Note:  In  cases  where  triad  analysis  is  not  attainable,  the  diad  isotacticity  and  diad syndiotacticity may be defined as the fractions of diads in a regular-vinyl polymer that are of the m and r types, respectively.

## 4.2 degrees of cistacticity and transtacticity

For  a  regular  polymer  containing  double  bonds  in  the  main  chain  of  the  constitutional repeating units, these are the fractions of such double bonds that are in the cis and trans configurations, respectively.

## 4.3 degree of crystallinity
