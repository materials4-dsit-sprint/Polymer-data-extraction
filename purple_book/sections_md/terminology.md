## PREAMBLE

In order to present clear concepts it is necessary that idealized definitions be adopted but it is recognized that the realities of polymer science must be faced. Deviations from ideality arise with polymers at both molecular and bulk levels in ways that have no parallel with the ordinary small molecules of organic or inorganic chemistry. Although such deviations are not explicitly taken into account in the definitions below, the terms recommended can usefully  be  applied  to  the predominant structural  features  of  real  polymer  molecules,  if necessary  with  self-explanatory,  if  imprecise,  qualifications  such  as  'essentially….', 'almost completely….', or 'highly….'. Although such expressions lack the rigour beloved by  the  purist,  every  experienced  polymer  scientist  knows  that  communication  in  this discipline is impossible without them.

Conventionally,  the  word polymer used  as  a  noun  is  ambiguous;  it  is  commonly employed  to  refer  to  both  polymer  substances  and  polymer  molecules.  Henceforth, macromolecule is used for individual molecules and polymer is used to denote a substance composed  of macromolecules . Polymer may  also  be  employed  unambiguously  as  an adjective, according to accepted usage, e.g., polymer blend , polymer molecule .

## 1 MOLECULES AND MOLECULAR STRUCTURE

## 1.1 macromolecule

## polymer molecule

Molecule of high relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises the multiple  repetition  of  units  derived,  actually  or  conceptually,  from  molecules  of  low relative molecular mass.

Note 1: In many cases, especially for synthetic polymers ,  a  molecule can be regarded as having a high relative molecular mass if the addition or removal of one or a few of the units has a negligible effect on the molecular properties. This statement fails in the case of certain properties of macromolecules which may be critically dependent on fine details of the molecular structure, e.g., the enzymatic properties of polypeptides.

R. F. T. Stepto  (UK),  and  U.  W.  Suter  (Switzerland).  Reprinted  from Pure  Appl.  Chem. 68 (1996).

Note  2:  If  a  part  or  the  whole  of  the  molecule  has  a  high  relative  molecular  mass  and essentially  comprises  the  multiple  repetition  of  units  derived,  actually  or  conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass, it may be described as either macromolecular or polymeric, or by polymer used adjectivally.

Note 3: In most cases, the polymer can actually be made by direct polymerization of  its parent monomer but in other cases, e.g., poly(vinyl alcohol), the description 'conceptual' denotes that an indirect route is used because the nominal monomer does not exist.

## 1.2 oligomer molecule

Molecule  of  intermediate  relative  molecular  mass,  the  structure  of  which  essentially comprises a small plurality of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of lower relative molecular mass.

Note 1: A molecule is regarded as having an intermediate relative molecular mass if it has properties which do vary significantly with the removal of one or a few of the units.

Note 2: If a part or the whole of the molecule has an intermediate relative molecular mass and essentially comprises a small plurality of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules  of  lower  relative  molecular  mass,  it  may  be  described  as  oligomeric,  or  by oligomer used adjectivally.

These monomers can  readily  be  visualized  as  reacting  to  give  an  'implicit  monomer'  or

'hypothetical monomer', the homo polymerization of which would give the actual product,

which  can  be  regarded  as  a  homopolymer.  Well-known  examples  are  poly(ethylene terephthalate) and poly( N , N '-hexane-1,6-diyladipamide).

Note 2: Some polymer s are obtained by the chemical modification of other polymer s such that  the  structure  of  the macromolecules that  constitute  the  resulting polymer can  be thought of as having been formed by the homo polymerization of a hypothetical monomer .

These polymer s can be regarded as homopolymers.  A well-known example is poly(vinyl alcohol).

Note  3:  A polymer uniform  with  respect  only  to  either  relative  molecular  mass  or constitution may be termed uniform, provided a suitable qualifier is used (e.g., 'a polymer uniform with respect to relative molecular mass').

Note 4: The adjectives monodisperse and polydisperse are deeply rooted in the literature, despite the former being non-descriptive and self-contradictory. They are in common usage and it is recognized that they will continue to be used for some time; nevertheless, more satisfactory terms are clearly desirable. After an extensive search for possible replacements, the terms uniform and non-uniform have been selected and they are now the preferred adjectives.

Note 1: A chain polymerization consists of initiation and propagation reactions, and may also include termination and chain-transfer reactions.

Note 2: The adjective chain in chain polymerization denotes a chain reaction rather than a polymer chain .

Note 3: Propagation in chain polymerization usually occurs without the formation of small molecules. However, cases exist where a low molar-mass by-product is formed, as in the polymerization of  oxazolidine-2,5-diones  derived  from  amino  acids  (commonly  termed amino  acid N -carboxy  anhydrides).  When  a  low-molar-mass  by-product  is  formed,  the adjective condensative is recommended to give the term condensative chain polymerization.

Note 4: The growth steps are expressed by

```
P x + M → P x +1 (+ L) { x } ∈ {1, 2, ... ∞ }
```

## GLOSSARY OF BASIC TERMS IN POLYMER SCIENCE

where P x denotes the growing chain of degree of polymerization x , M a monomer , and L a low-molar-mass by-product formed in the case of condensative chain polymerization.

Note 5: The term chain polymerization may be qualified further, if necessary, to specify the type of chemical reactions involved in the growth step, e.g., ring-opening chain polymerization, cationic chain polymerization.

Note 6: There exist, exceptionally, some polymerizations that proceed via chain reactions that, according to the definition, are not chain polymerizations. For example, the polymerization

proceeds via a radical chain reaction with intermolecular transfer of the radical center. The growth step, however, involves reactions between molecules of all degrees of polymerization and, hence, the polymerization is classified as a polyaddition. If required, the classification can be made more precise and the polymerization described as a chainreaction polyaddition.

## 3.7 polycondensation

Polymerization in which the growth of polymer chains proceeds by condensation reactions between molecules of all degrees of polymerization .

Note 1: The growth steps are expressed by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where P x and  P y denote chains of degree of polymerization x and y ,  respectively,  and  L denotes a low-molar- mass by-product.

Note 2: The earlier term polycondensation was synonymous with condensation polymerization.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  current  definitions  of  polycondensation  and condensative chain polymerization were both embraced by the earlier term polycondensation.

## 3.8 polyaddition

Polymerization in  which  the  growth  of polymer chains proceeds  by  addition  reactions between molecules of all degrees of polymerization .

Note 1: The growth steps are expressed by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where P x and P y denote chains of degrees of polymerization x and y , respectively.

Note 2: The earlier term addition polymerization embraced both the current concepts of polyaddition and chain polymerization , but did not include condensative chain polymerization .

## 3.9 statistical copolymerization

Copolymerization in which a statistical copolymer is formed.

## 3.10 random copolymerization

Copolymerization in which a random copolymer is formed.

## 3.11 alternating copolymerization

Copolymerization in which an alternating copolymer is formed.

## TERMINOLOGY

## 3.12 periodic copolymerization

Copolymerization in which a periodic copolymer is formed.

## 3.13 ring-opening polymerization

Polymerization in  which  a  cyclic monomer yields  a monomeric unit which  is  acyclic  or contains fewer cycles than the monomer .

Note: If the monomer is polycyclic, the opening of a single ring is sufficient to classify the reaction as a ring-opening polymerization.

## 3.14 ring-opening copolymerization

Copolymerization which  is  a ring-opening  polymerization with  respect  to  at  least  one monomer .

## 3.15 radical polymerization

Chain polymerization in which the kinetic-chain carriers are radicals.

Note: Usually, the growing chain end bears an unpaired electron.

## 3.16 radical copolymerization

Copolymerization which is a radical polymerization .

## 3.17 ionic polymerization

Chain polymerization in which the kinetic-chain carriers are ions or ion-pairs.

Note: Usually, the growing chain ends are ions.

## 3.18 ionic copolymerization

Copolymerization which is an ionic polymerization .

## 3.19 anionic polymerization

Ionic polymerization in which the kinetic-chain carriers are anions.

## 3.20 cationic polymerization

Ionic polymerization in which the kinetic-chain carriers are cations.

## 3.21 living polymerization

Chain polymerization from which chain transfer and chain termination are absent.

Note:  In  many  cases,  the  rate  of  chain  initiation  is  fast  compared  with  the  rate  of  chain propagation, so that the number of kinetic-chain carriers is essentially constant throughout the polymerization .

## 3.22 living copolymerization

Copolymerization which is a living polymerization .

## 3.23 cyclopolymerization

Polymerization in  which the number of cyclic structures in the constitutional units of the resulting macromolecules is larger than in the monomer molecules .

## 3.24 chain scission

Chemical reaction resulting in the breaking of skeletal bonds.

## 3.25 depolymerization

Process of converting a polymer into its monomer or a mixture of monomers .

Note:  Unzipping  is  depolymerization  occurring  by  a  sequence  of  reactions,  progressing along  a macromolecule and  yielding  products,  usually monomer  molecules ,  at  each reaction step, from which macromolecules similar to the original can be regenerated.
