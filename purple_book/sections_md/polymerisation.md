In its report on 'Basic Definitions of Terms Relating to Polymers' published in 1974 [1], the  IUPAC  Commission  on  Macromolecular  Nomenclature  defined  the  terms  'addition polymerization' (polymerization by repeated addition processes) and 'condensation polymerization' (polymerization by repeated condensation  processes, i. e., with the elimination  of  small  molecules).  At  that  time,  the  terms  were  intended  to  classify polymerization reactions according to  whether or not small molecules are formed in the growth  reaction.  Meanwhile,  widespread  use  of  the  term  addition  polymerization  for polymerizations with growth steps that are chain reactions has resulted in the introduction of alternative terms aimed at a clear distinction in terminology between the chain or nonchain nature of the growth reaction and the stoichiometry associated with the formation or non-formation of a small molecule during that reaction [2]. Most prominent amongst these are the terms 'chain-growth polymerization' and 'step-growth polymerization.' However, conflicting  usage  in  the  literature  and  contradictory  explanations  of  these  terms  in textbooks indicate the timeliness of a new set of definitions.

The definitions given in this document use a single term for polymerizations in which polymer  chains  grow  via  chain-reaction  mechanisms,  with  the  stoichiometry  specified additionally, if so desired. 'Polyaddition' and 'polycondensation' are invoked only in the naming of polymerizations proceeding through reactions between molecules of all degrees of  polymerization.  The  definitions  are  in  accord  with  the  IUPAC  terms  for  organic chemistry [3] and the basic definitions [1].

## DEFINITIONS

## 1 chain polymerization

Chain  reaction  in  which  the  growth  of  a  polymer  chain  proceeds  exclusively  by  the reaction or reactions between a monomer or monomers and a reactive site or reactive sites on the polymer chain with regeneration of the reactive site or reactive sites at the end of each growth step.

## CLASSIFICATION OF POLYMERIZATION REACTIONS

Note  1:  A chain polymerization consists of initiation and propagation reactions, and may also include termination and chain-transfer reactions.

Note  2:  The  adjective  'chain'  in  'chain  polymerization'  denotes  'chain  reaction'  rather than 'polymer chain'.

Note  3:  Propagation in chain polymerization often occurs without the formation of small molecules.  However,  cases  exist  where,  at  each  propagation  step,  a  low-molar-mass  byproduct  is  formed,  as  in  the  polymerization  of  1,3-oxazolidine-2,5-diones  derived  from amino  acids  (commonly  termed  amino  acid N -carboxyanhydrides).  When  a  low-molarmass by-product is formed, the adjective condensative is  recommended to give the term 'condensative chain polymerization'.

Note 4:  The growth steps are expressed by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where P x denotes the growing chain of degree of polymerization x , M a monomer and L a low-molar-mass by-product formed in the case of condensative chain polymerization.

Note 5:  The term 'chain polymerization' may be qualified further, if necessary, to specify the  type  of  chemical  reactions  involved  in  the  growth  step,  e.g.  ring-opening  chain polymerization or cationic chain polymerization.

Note 6:  There  exist,  exceptionally,  some  polymerizations  that  can  proceed  via  chain reactions that, according to the definition, are not chain polymerizations. For example, the polymerization

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

proceeds via a radical chain reaction with intermolecular transfer of the radical centre. The growth step, however, involves reactions between molecules of all degrees of polymerization and, hence, the polymerization is classified as a polyaddition. If required, the classification can be made more precise and the polymerization described as a chainreaction polyaddition.

## 2 polycondensation

Polymerization in which the growth of polymer chains proceeds by condensation reactions between molecules of all degrees of polymerization.

Note  1:  The growth steps may be expressed by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where P x and P y denote chains of degrees of polymerization x and y ,  respectively, and L denotes a low-molar-mass by-product.

Note  2:  The  earlier  term  'polycondensation'  (namely,  polymerization  by  a  repeated condensation process, i.e., with elimination of simple molecules [1]) was synonymous with 'condensation polymerization'. It should be noted that the current definitions of polycondensation  and  condensative  chain  polymerization  were both embraced  by  the earlier term 'polycondensation'.

## 3 polyaddition

Polymerization  in  which  the  growth  of  polymer  chains  proceeds  by  addition  reactions between molecules of all degrees of polymerization.

## TERMINOLOGY

Note  1:  The growth steps may be expressed by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where P x and P y denote chains of degrees of polymerization x and y , respectively. Note  2:  The earlier term 'addition polymerization' (as defined in [1]) embraced both the current  concepts  of  'polyaddition'  and  'chain  polymerization',  but  did  not  include 'condensative chain polymerization'.

## SUMMARY

The classification of the types of polymerization resulting from the definitions, except for the polymerizations of Definition 1, Note 6, may be summarized in the following table:

| GROWTH                                                                 |                            | STOICHIOMETRY                       | STOICHIOMETRY                          |

## PREAMBLE

The contribution of Professor Sigwalt to the conception of this chapter is acknowledged. He  started  working  on  it  in  1981,  but  originally  there  was  no  agreement  within  the Commission  and  with  outside  specialists  in  organic  chemistry.  The  current  document reflects  the  continuation  of  this  work  with  the  assistance  from  the  former  IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry.

Basic definitions of terms relating to polymerization reactions [1,2] and stereochemical definitions  and  notations  relating  to  polymers  [3]  have  been  published,  but  no  reference was made explicitly to reactions involving the asymmetric synthesis of polymers. It is the aim  of  the  present  document  to  recommend  classification  and  definitions  relating  to asymmetric polymerizations that may produce optically active polymers.

As in Chapter 2 and in previous IUPAC documents [1,3], the rotated Fischer projection is  used  to  denote  a  polymer  backbone  by  a  horizontal  line.  Hence, at  each  individual backbone carbon atom the horizontal lines represent the bonds directed below the plane of the paper from the carbon atom while the vertical lines project above the plane of the paper from the carbon atom. Thus the rotated Fischer projection ∗ of

## DEFINITIONS

## 1 asymmetric polymerization

Polymerization that proceeds in an unsymmetrical manner in terms of chirality under the influence of chiral features present in one or more components of the reaction system.

∗ Usually in Fischer projections the carbon atoms of the main chain are omitted [4]. In general, in the area of macromolecular chemistry, element symbols are not omitted in the backbone and are usually shown in the rotated Fischer projection [3].

Note 1:  An  asymmetric  polymerization  generally  produces  a  polymer  which  contains chirality centres of opposite configuration in unequal amounts.

Note 2:  Chiral features may be present in monomers, solvents, initiators, catalysts and supports.

Note 3:  Polymerization is defined as the process of converting a monomer or a mixture of monomers into a polymer [1]. Thus the definition of an asymmetric polymerization covers homopolymerization and copolymerization.

Note 4:  Some  stereospecific  polymerizations  produce  tactic  polymers  [3]  that  contain  a mixture of pairs of enantiomeric polymer molecules in equal amounts. For example, in the case of a polymerization leading to an isotactic polymer the product consists of

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and their corresponding enantiomers

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

in equal amounts; here, -R- and -S- represent enantiomeric configurational repeating units. The product can be considered to be a mixture of polymer racemates because a racemate is defined as an equimolar mixture of enantiomers [4]. Such polymerizations can be named by using the adjective 'racemate-forming', as in 'racemate-forming chirogenic polymerization' (see Note 4 to Definition 2) and 'racemate-forming enantiomerdifferentiating polymerization' (see Note 2 to Definition 3). Polymerizations of prochiral substituted ethenes leading to atactic polymers  usually give  enantiomeric  polymer molecules  in equal amounts.  However,  use  of  the  adjective  'racemate-forming'  is discouraged for such cases where a mixture of polymer racemates molecules with the same degree of polymerization consists of a large number of diastereomers.

## 2 asymmetric chirogenic polymerization

Asymmetric polymerization in which the polymer molecules formed contain one (or more) new type(s) of elements of chirality not existing in the starting monomer(s).

Note 1:  The new elements of chirality generated in the course of the polymerization may be new types of chirality centres in the polymer molecules (see Notes 2, 4, and 5 to Definition 2) or may arise from the helicity of the polymer molecules (see Note 3 to Definition 2).

Note 2:  In  asymmetric  chirogenic  polymerizations  of  some  prochiral  monomers,  such  as Examples  2.1  and  2.2,  at  least  one  new  type  of  chirality  centre  in  the  main  chain  is generated  at  each  propagation  step,  which  lead  to  polymer  molecules  having  the  same configuration  ( R or S )  at  each  corresponding  chirality  centre.  The  resulting  polymer  is isotactic and optically active.

Note 3:  Some  asymmetric  chirogenic  polymerizations  give  helical  polymer  molecules  of only one screw sense that usually show optical activity due to the helicity (see Examples 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7). These  polymerizations are termed 'asymmetric helix-chirogenic polymerizations'.

Note 4:  Some  polymerizations  produce  enantiomeric  polymer  molecules  in  equal  amounts; each polymer molecule contains, in its main chain, a single type of chirality centre that does not  exist  in  the  starting  monomer.  The  resulting  polymer  is  optically  inactive,  and  the polymerization  is  not  an  asymmetric  chirogenic  polymerization.  Such  a  polymerization  is termed  a  'racemate-forming  chirogenic  polymerization'.  The  polymerizations  described  in Examples  2.5,  2.6 and  2.7, carried out using an optically inactive initiator of the corresponding  racemate,  are  examples  of  racemate-forming  chirogenic  polymerizations.

Another example is the polymerization of penta-1,3-diene with an optically inactive initiator of the corresponding racemate (see Example 2.1), which leads to an isotactic product.

Note 5:  In some polymerizations of vinyl monomers leading to isotactic polymers using an optically active initiator, stereorepeating units [3] of one type of chirality centre are formed at  every  propagation  step.  Hence,  they  give  only  one  type  of  enantiomeric  polymer molecule (A or B), and are asymmetric chirogenic polymerizations. Optical activities of the  resulting  isotactic  polymers  are  usually  very  small  or  not  detectable,  because  the polymer  molecules  can  be  regarded  as  having  a  plane  of  symmetry  if  their  degrees  of polymerization are so large that the presence of their end-groups is negligible.

<!-- image -->

In usual polymerizations of vinyl monomers leading to isotactic polymers, the enantiomeric  polymer  molecules  (A)  and  (B)  are  formed  in  equal  amounts,  and  the polymerizations are not asymmetric but racemate-forming chirogenic polymerizations.

## Example 2.1

Polymerization of penta-1,3-diene by 1,4-addition with an optically active catalyst gives an optically  active  polymer  comprising  configurational  repeating  units  with  predominantly one type of chirality centre.

<!-- image -->

## Example 2.2

Polymerization of 1-benzofuran with an optically active initiator gives the optically active polymer,  poly[(2 R ,3 S )-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-2,3-diyl],  containing  predominantly  one type of stereorepeating unit.

<!-- image -->

## Example 2.3

Polymerization  of cis -2,3-dimethylthiirane  with  an  optically  active  initiator  results  in  an optically active polymer, poly{sulfanediyl[(1 R ,2 R )-1,2-dimethylethylene]}, containing predominantly RR configurational  repeating  units.  Inversion  of  configuration  occurs  on ring opening, which gives contiguous monomer units with two identical chirality centres.

## Example 2.4

Copolymerization of a monomer having two styrene moieties attached to a chiral template molecule  with  a  comonomer  ( e.g .,  methyl  methacrylate)  gives  copolymers  with  strong optical activity after removal of the template molecules. In this case styrene diads of an S , S configuration separated from other styrene diads by comonomeric units are responsible for the optical activity.

## Example 2.5

A polymerization of a bulky methacrylate ester ( e.g . trityl methacrylate) using an optically active anionic initiator can give an isotactic polymer, poly{1-methyl-1[(trityloxy)carbonyl]ethylene}of  high  optical  activity  owing  to  the  formation  of  helical polymer molecules with units of predominantly one chirality sense.

## Example 2.6

Polymerization of trichloroacetaldehyde in bulk using an optically active initiator gives an isotactic  polymer,  poly{oxy[(trichloromethyl)methylene]}, of high optical activity owing to the formation of the helical polymer molecules with units of predominantly one chirality sense.

## Example 2.7

Polymerization of tert -butyl isocyanide using an optically active initiator gives an optically active  product  comprising  helical  polymer  molecules  with  units  of  predominantly  one chirality sense.

## 3 asymmetric enantiomer-differentiating polymerization

Asymmetric  polymerization in  which,  starting  from  a  mixture  of  enantiomeric  monomer molecules, only one enantiomer is polymerized.

Note 1:  A  'stereoselective  polymerization'  is  defined  as  'a  polymerization  in  which  a polymer molecule is formed from a mixture of stereoisomeric monomer molecules by the incorporation of only one stereoisomeric species' [1]. Thus, an asymmetric enantiomerdifferentiating  polymerization  is  a stereoselective  polymerization ,  in  which  all  the polymer  molecules  are  formed  by  the  incorporation  of  only  one  type  of  stereoisomeric species.

Note 2:  A polymerization in which, starting from the racemate of a chiral monomer, two types  of  polymer  molecules,  each  containing  monomeric  units  derived  from  one  of  the enantiomers, form in equal amounts is termed 'racemate-forming enantiomerdifferentiating polymerization'. The resulting polymer is optically inactive (see Note 4 of Definition 2).

## Example 3.1

Polymerization of racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene (MP) using an optically active catalyst may give  an  optically  active  polymer  by  a  polymerization  that  is  partially  asymmetric; preferential consumption of one of the two enantiomers leaves a monomer mixture having optical activity.

## Example 3.2

Polymerization of racemic 1-phenylethyl methacrylate (PEMA) using a chiral complex of a Grignard reagent with a diamine as an initiator may proceed by reaction of only one of the two enantiomers to give an optically active polymer.

## Example 3.3

Polymerization  of  racemic  methylthiirane  (MT)  using  an  optically  active  initiator  may proceed by reaction of only one of the two enantiomers to produce stereoregular polymer molecules, comprising only one type of configurational repeating unit, as a result of either complete  retention  or  complete  inversion  of  configuration  at  the  chirality  centre  of  the monomer.  The  following  reaction  scheme  represents  the  case  of  complete  retention  of monomer configuration in the polymer formed, which is optically active.

Example  3.4 :  Polymerization  of  racemic trans -2,3-dimethylthiirane  (DMT)  using  an optically active initiator may proceed by reaction of only one of the two enantiomers to give  stereoregular  but  optically  inactive,  non-chiral  polymer  molecules  as  a  result  of inversion of the configuration of the attacked carbon atom.
