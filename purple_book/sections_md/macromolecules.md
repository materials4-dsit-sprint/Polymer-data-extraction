## PREAMBLE

This  document  is  part  of  a  series  published  by  the  Commission  on  Macromolecular Nomenclature dealing with definitions for the important terms in polymer science [1-3]. The recommendations presented here deal with such key areas of the physical chemistry of macromolecules  as  individual  macromolecules,  their  assemblies  and  dilute  polymer solutions; they include recommended terminology for molecular weight, molecular-weight averages, distribution functions, radius of gyration, the Flory-Huggins theory, viscosity of solutions, scattering of radiation by polymers, fractionation, etc.

The reader's attention is especially directed to the new terms 'uniform polymer' and 'nonuniform polymer' which denote polymers composed of molecules that are uniform or nonuniform, respectively, with respect to relative molecular mass and constitution. These terms replaced the widely used, but non-descriptive and self-contradictory terms 'monodisperse polymer' and 'polydisperse polymer'.

## 1 INDIVIDUAL MACROMOLECULES

## 1.1 relative molecular mass, M r molecular weight

Ratio of the average mass per formula unit of a substance to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of nuclide 12 C.

Note:  See Definition 1.2.

## 1.2 molar mass , M

Mass divided by amount of substance.

Note  1: Molar mass is usually expressed in g mol -1 or kg mol -1 units. The g mol -1 unit is recommended in polymer science, since then the numerical values of the molar mass and the relative molecular mass of a substance are equal.

Originally  prepared  by  a  working  group  consisting  of  P.  Kratochvíl  (Czech  Republic)  and  U.  W.  Suter (Switzerland). Reprinted from Pure Appl. Chem. 61 , 211-241 (1989), with changes and corrections (2006).

## INDIVIDUAL MACROMOLECULES

Note  2: Relative molecular mass (relative molar mass, molecular weight ) is a pure number and must not be associated with any units.

Note  3: The dalton, symbol Da, is an alternative name for the unified atomic mass unit, m u, symbol u, i.e., m u = 1 u.

Note  4:  The  terms  'molar'  and  'molecular'  may  also be  used  for  particles  consisting  of more than one molecule, such as complexes, aggregates, micelles, etc.

Note  5: If there is no danger of confusion, the subscript r in the recommended symbol for the relative molecular mass, M r, may be omitted.

## 1.3 degree of polymerization ( DP) , X

Number of monomeric units in a macromolecule or an oligomer molecule, a block, or a chain.

## 1.4 thermodynamically equivalent sphere

Sphere, impenetrable to other spheres, displaying the same excluded volume as an actual polymer molecule.

## 1.5 short-range intramolecular interaction

Steric or other interaction involving atoms or groups or both situated nearby in sequence along a polymer chain.

Note  1:  The  interacting  atoms  or  groups  are  typically  separated  by  fewer  than  ten consecutive bonds in a chain.

Note  2: If no confusion can occur, the word 'intramolecular' may be omitted.

## 1.6 long-range intramolecular interaction

Interaction  between  segments,  widely  separated  in  sequence  along  a  polymer  chain,  that occasionally approach one another during molecular flexing.

Note  1: This type of interaction is closely related to the excluded volume of a segment , the latter quantity reflecting interactions involving segments and solvent molecules.

Note  2: If no confusion can occur, the word 'intramolecular' may be omitted.

## 1.7 unperturbed dimensions

Dimensions of an actual polymer random coil in a theta state .

## 1.8 perturbed dimensions

Dimensions of an actual polymer random coil not in a theta state .

## 1.9 radius of gyration , s , 1/ 2 2 〉 〈 s

Parameter characterizing the size of a particle of any shape.

For a rigid particle consisting of mass elements of mass mi ,  each located at a distance ri from  the  centre  of  mass,  the  radius  of  gyration, s ,  is  defined  as  the  square  root  of  the mass-average of ri 2 for all the mass elements, i.e.,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For a non-rigid particle, an average over all conformations is considered, i.e.,

## TERMINOLOGY

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note: The subscript zero is used to indicate unperturbed dimensions as in 1/ 2 0 2 〉 〈 s .

## 1.10 end-to-end vector , r /barb2right r

Vector connecting the two ends of a linear macromolecular chain in a particular conformation.

## 1.11 end-to-end distance , r

Length of the end-to-end vector .

## 1.12 root-mean-square end-to-end distance , 1/ 2 2 〉 〈 r

Square  root  of  the  mean-square end-to-end  distance of  a  linear  macromolecular  chain averaged over all conformations of the chain. For a freely  jointed  chain consisting  of N segments each of length L , L N r 1/ 2 1/ 2 2 = 〉 〈 .

Note  1: The subscript zero is used to indicate unperturbed dimensions , as in 1/ 2 0 2 〉 〈 r .

Note  2:  If  this  term  is  used  repeatedly,  and  if  it  is  not  confusing,  the  abbreviated  name 'end-to-end distance' may be used.

## 1.13 characteristic ratio , CN ( C ∞ when N → ∞ )

Ratio of the mean-square end-to-end distance , 0 2 〉 〈 r , of a linear macromolecular chain in a theta state to N L 2 , where N is the number of rigid sections in the main chain, each of length L ;  if  all  of  the rigid sections are not of equal length, the mean-square value of L is  used, i.e.,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note: In simple single-strand chains, the bonds are taken as the rigid sections.

## 1.14 contour length

Maximum end-to-end distance of a linear macromolecular chain.

Note  1: For a single-strand polymer molecule with skeletal bonds all joined by the same value of valence angle, the contour length is equal to the end-to-end distance of the chain extended to the all-trans conformation. For chains of complex structures, only approximate values of the contour length may be accessible.

Note  2: The sum of the lengths of all skeletal bonds of a single-strand polymer molecule is occasionally termed 'contour length'. This use of the term in this sense is discouraged.

## 1.15 random coil, statistical coil

Complete set of spatial arrangements of a chain molecule with a large number of segments that  randomly  change  mutual  orientation  with  time,  under  conditions  in  which  it  is  free from external constraints that would affect its conformation.

Note: If the solution of  the chain molecules is not in a theta state ,  the  segments  change mutual orientation only approximately randomly.

## 1.16 freely jointed chain

Hypothetical  linear  chain  consisting  of  infinitely  thin  rectilinear  segments  uniform  in length, each of which can take all orientations in space with equal probability, independently of its neighbours.

Note 1:  For  models  in  which  the  segments  are  not  all  uniform  in  length,  the  name 'random-walk chain' has been used.

Note 2: In the freely-jointed-chain approach, two or more segments can occupy the same volume simultaneously.

## 1.17 equivalent chain

Hypothetical freely  jointed  chain with  the  same mean-square  end-to-end  distance and contour length as an actual macromolecular chain in a theta state .

## 1.18 statistical segment

Segment of an actual macromolecular chain which behaves, with respect to some property, virtually as a segment of a freely jointed chain .

## 1.19 freely rotating chain

Hypothetical  linear  chain  molecule,  free  from short-range and long-range  interactions , consisting of infinitely thin rectilinear segments (bonds) of fixed length, jointed at fixed bond angles; the torsion angles of the bonds can assume all values with equal probability.

## 1.20 steric factor , σ

Ratio  of  the root-mean-square  end-to-end  distance of  a  macromolecular  chain  with unperturbed dimensions , 1/ 2 0 2 〉 〈 r , to that of a freely rotating chain with the same structure,

1/ 2 0, f 2 〉 〈 r , i.e., ( ) 1/ 2 0, f 2 0 2 〉 〈 〉 〈 r r in the limit of infinite chain length.

Note: The steric factor reflects the effect of hindrance to free rotation.

## 1.21 worm-like chain

## continuously curved chain

Hypothetical linear macromolecule consisting of an infinitely thin chain of continuous curvature; the direction of curvature at any point is random.

Note  1:  The model describes the whole spectrum of chains with different degrees of chain stiffness  from rigid rods to random coils ,  and  is  particularly  useful  for  representing  stiff chains.

Note  2:  In the literature this chain is sometimes referred to as Porod-Kratky chain.

## 1.22 persistence length , a

Average projection of the end-to-end vector on the tangent to the chain contour at a chain end in the limit of infinite chain length.

Note: The persistence length is the basic characteristic of the worm-like chain .

## 1.23 short-chain branch

Oligomeric offshoot from a macromolecular chain.

## 1.24 long-chain branch

Polymeric offshoot from a macromolecular chain.

## TERMINOLOGY

## 1.25 branching index , g

Parameter  characterizing  the  effect  of long-chain  branches on  the  size  of  a  branched molecule in solution and defined as the ratio of the mean-square radius of gyration of  a branched molecule, 〉 〈 2 b s , to that of an otherwise identical linear molecule 〉 〈 2 l s , with the same relative  molecular  mass in the same  solvent at the same  temperature, i.e., 〉 〈 〉 = 〈 2 l 2 b s s g .

## 1.26 network

Highly ramified polymer structure in which each constitutional unit is connected to each other constitutional unit and to the macroscopic phase boundary by many permanent paths through  the  structure,  their  number  increasing  with  the  average  number  of  intervening bonds; these paths must on the average be coextensive with this structure.

Note 1: Usually, and in  all  systems  that  exhibit rubber  elasticity,  the  number  of  distinct paths is very high, but some constitutional units exist, in most cases, which are connected by  a  single  path  only.  Sometimes,  a  structure  without  any  multiple  path  has  also  been called a network.

Note  2:  If  the  permanent  paths  through  the  structure  of  a  network  are  all  formed  by covalent bonds, the term covalent network may be used.

Note  3:  The  term  physical  network  may  be  used  if  the  permanent  paths  through  the structure of a network are not all formed by covalent bonds but, at least in part, by physical interactions, such that removal of the interactions leaves individual macromolecules or a macromolecule that is not a network.

Note 4: See also Definition 4.1.21 in Chapter 11.

## 1.27 microgel

Particle of a gel of any shape with an equivalent diameter of approximately 0.1 to 100 µ m.

## 1.28 copolymer micelle

Micelle formed by one or more block or graft copolymer molecules in a selective solvent .

## 2 ASSEMBLIES OF MACROMOLECULES

## 2.1 compositional heterogeneity

Variation in elemental composition from molecule to molecule usually found in copolymers.

## 2.2 constitutional heterogeneity

Variation in constitution from molecule to molecule in polymers with molecules uniform with respect to elemental composition.

Note:  An  example  is  a  polymer  composed  of  linear  and  branched  molecules;  another example is a statistical copolymer comprising two isomeric constitutional units.

## 2.3 uniform polymer

## monodisperse polymer

Polymer  composed  of  molecules  uniform  with  respect  to relative  molecular  mass and constitution.

Note  1:  A  polymer  comprising  a  mixture  of  linear  and  branched  chains,  all  of  uniform relative molecular mass , is not uniform.

Note  2: A copolymer comprising linear molecules of uniform relative molecular mass and uniform elemental composition, but different sequence arrangement of the various types of monomeric  units,  is  not  uniform  (e.g.,  a  copolymer  comprising  molecules  with  random arrangement as well as block arrangement of monomeric units).

Note  3:  A  polymer  uniform  with  respect  only  to  either  relative  molecular  mass  or constitution  may  be  termed  'uniform',  provided  a  suitable  qualifier  is  used  (e.g.,  'a polymer uniform with respect to relative molecular mass').

Note  4:  The  adjectives  'monodisperse'  and  'polydisperse'  are  deeply  rooted  in  the literature despite being non-descriptive and self-contradictory. They are in common usage and it is recognized that they will continue to be used for a certain time, nevertheless more satisfactory terms are clearly desirable. After an extensive search for possible replacements, the new terms 'uniform' and 'non-uniform' have been selected and they are now the preferred adjectives.

## 2.4 non-uniform polymer polydisperse polymer

Polymer comprising molecules non-uniform with respect to relative molecular mass or constitution or both.

Note: See Definition 2.3, Note 3.

## 2.5 molar-mass average, k M ,

relative-molecular-mass average/molecular-weight average , r, k M

Any average of the molar mass or relative molecular mass ( molecular weight ) for a nonuniform polymer. In both symbols, k specifies the type of average.

Note  1: An infinite number of molar-mass averages can in principle be defined, but only a few types of averages are directly accessible experimentally. The most important averages are defined by simple moments of the distribution functions and are obtained by methods applied to systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, such as osmometry, light scattering and sedimentation  equilibrium.  Hydrodynamic  methods,  as  a  rule,  yield  more  complex molar-mass averages.

Note  2:  Any  molar-mass  average  can  be  defined  in  terms  of  mass  fractions  or  mole fractions. In this document only a few of the important molar-mass averages are given in terms of the mass fractions, wi ,  of  the  species with molar mass Mi .  These definitions are most closely related to the experimental determination of molar-mass averages.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## apparent molecular weight

## 2.12 average degree of polymerization, k X

Average of the degree of polymerization for a polymer, where k specifies the type of average.

Note: Definitions 2.5-2.10 apply directly to averages of the degree of polymerization when X is substituted for M in the formulae.

## 2.13 distribution function

Normalized function giving the relative amount of a portion of a polymeric substance with a specific value, or a range of values, of a random variable or variables.

Note  1: Distribution functions may be discrete, i.e., take on only certain specified values of the random variable(s), or continuous, i.e., take on any intermediate value of the random variable(s),  in  a  given  range.  Most  distributions  in  polymer  science  are  intrinsically discrete,  but  it  is  often  convenient  to  regard  them  as  continuous  or  to  use  distribution functions that are inherently continuous.

Note  2: Distribution functions may be integral (or cumulative), i.e., give the proportion of the  population  for  which  a  random  variable  is  less  than  or  equal  to  a  given  value. Alternatively  they  may  be  differential  distribution functions  (or probability  density functions), i.e., give the (maybe infinitesimal) proportion of the population for which the random variable(s) is (are) within a (maybe infinitesimal) interval of its (their) range(s).

Note  3: Normalization requires that: (i) for a discrete differential distribution function, the sum of the function values over all possible values of the random variable(s) be unity; (ii) for a continuous differential distribution function, the integral over the entire range of the random  variable(s)  be  unity;  (iii)  for  an  integral  (cumulative)  distribution  function,  the function value at the upper limit of the random variable(s) be unity.

## 2.14 number-distribution function

Distribution  function in  which  the  relative  amount  of  a  portion  of  a  substance  with  a specific value, or a range of values, of the random variable(s) is expressed in terms of mole fraction.

## TERMINOLOGY

## 2.15 mass-distribution function

## weight-distribution function

Distribution  function in  which  the  relative  amount  of  a  portion  of  a  substance  with  a specific value, or a range of values, of the random variable(s) is expressed in terms of mass fraction.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where x is a parameter characterizing the chain length, such as relative molecular mass or degree of polymerization , a and b are  positive adjustable parameters, and Γ( b +  1)  is  the gamma function of argument ( b + 1).

## 2.17 most probable distribution

Discrete distribution with the differential mass-distribution function of the form

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For definitions of symbols, see Definition 2.16.

Note  1: For large values of x ,  the most probable distribution converges to the particular case of the Schulz-Zimm distribution with b = 1.

Note  2: In the literature, this distribution is sometimes referred to as the Flory distribution or the Schulz-Flory distribution.

## 2.18 Poisson distribution

## 3 DILUTE POLYMER SOLUTIONS

## 3.1 General and Thermodynamic Terms

## 3.1.1 dilute solution

Solution in which the sum of the volumes of the domains occupied by the solute molecules or particles is substantially less than the total volume of the solution.

Note: The term 'domain' refers to the smallest convex body that contains the molecule or particle in its average shape.

## 3.1.2 cross-over concentration , c * overlap concentration

Concentration  range  at  which  the  sum  of  the  volumes  of  the  domains  occupied  by  the solute molecules or particles in solution is approximately equal to the total volume of that solution.

Note  1: For the meaning of the term 'domain', see the note in Definition 3.1.1.

Note  2: Cross-over concentration is defined as a range because different measurement techniques give different values. The symbol c * refers usually to amount concentration, but in polymer science it is generally used for mass concentration.

## 3.1.3 polymer-solvent interaction

Sum  of  the  effects  of  all  intermolecular  interactions  between  polymer  and  solvent molecules in solution that are reflected in the values of the Gibbs and Helmholtz energies of mixing.

## 3.1.4 thermodynamic quality of solvent quality of solvent

Qualitative characterization of the polymer-solvent interaction . A solution of a polymer in a 'better' solvent is characterized by a higher value of the second virial coefficient than a solution of the same polymer in a 'poorer' solvent.

## 3.1.5 theta state

## θ state

State of a polymer solution for which the second virial coefficient is zero.

Note  1: In some respects, a polymer solution in the theta state resembles an ideal solution and the theta state may be referred to as a pseudo-ideal state. However, a solution in the theta state must not be identified with an ideal solution.

Note  2: The solvent involved is often referred to as 'theta solvent' or ' θ solvent'.

Note  3: It is assumed that the degree of polymerization of the polymer is high.

## 3.1.6 theta temperature ;

## θ , SI unit: K θ temperature

Temperature at which a solution is in the theta state .

## 3.1.7 virial coefficients , Ai where i =  1, 2, etc.

## virial coefficients of the chemical potential

Coefficients in the expansion of the chemical potential of the solvent, µ s, in powers of the mass concentration, c , of the solute, i.e.,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where o s µ is the chemical potential of the solvent in the reference state at the temperature of the system and ambient pressure, π is  the osmotic pressure and V s  is  the partial molar volume of  the  solvent.  In  solvents  comprising  more  than  one  component,  the  definition applies to any solvent component. The first virial coefficient is the reciprocal number-average  molar  mass ,  i.e., n 1 1 M A = .  The  second  and  higher  virial  coefficients, A 2 , A 3, ..., respectively, describe polymer-solvent and polymer-polymer interactions.

Note: The factor RT is sometimes included in the virial coefficients.

## 3.1.8 excluded volume of a segment

Volume  from  which  a  segment  of  a  macromolecule  in  solution  effectively  excludes  all other segments, i.e., those belonging to the same macromolecule as well as those belonging to other macromolecules.

Note: The excluded volume of a segment depends on the Gibbs and Helmholtz energies of mixing of solvent and polymer, i.e., on the thermodynamic quality of the solvent , and is not a measure of the geometrical volume of that segment.

## 3.1.9 excluded volume of a macromolecule

Volume from  which  a  macromolecule  in  a  dilute  solution  effectively  excludes  all  other macromolecules.

Note:  The  excluded  volume  of  a  macromolecule  depends  on  the  Gibbs  and  Helmholtz energies  of  mixing  of  solvent  and  polymer,  i.e.,  on  the thermodynamic  quality  of  the solvent , and is not a measure of the geometrical volume of that macromolecule.

/uniF02C

## 3.1.10 expansion factor α r , α s , αη

/uniF020

/f020

Ratio  of  a  dimensional  characteristic  of  a  macromolecule  in  a  given  solvent  at  a  given temperature  to  the  same  dimensional  characteristic  in  the theta state at  the  same temperature.  The  most  frequently  used  expansion  factors  are:  expansion  factor  of  the mean-square end-to-end distance , α r =  (&lt; r 2 &gt;/&lt; r 2 &gt;0) 1/2 ;  expansion  factor  of  the radius of gyration , α s = (&lt; s 2 &gt;/&lt; s 2 &gt;0) 1/2 ; relative viscosity , αη = ([ η ]/[ η ] 0 ) 1/3 , where [ η ] and [ η ]0 are the intrinsic  viscosity in  a  given  solvent  and  in  the theta  state at  the  same  temperature, respectively.

## INDIVIDUAL MACROMOLECULES

Note:  Expansion  factors  defined  by  different  dimensional  characteristics  are  not  exactly equal, nor need they have a constant ratio as a function of relative molecular mass.

## 3.1.11 Flory-Huggins theory

## Flory-Huggins-Staverman theory

Statistical thermodynamic  mean-field  theory of polymer  solutions, first formulated independently by Flory, Huggins, and Staverman, in which the thermodynamic quantities of the solution are derived from a simple concept of combinatorial entropy of mixing and a reduced Gibbs-energy parameter, the χ interaction parameter .

## 3.1.12 χ parameter , χ

## χ interaction parameter

Numerical parameter employed in the Flory-Huggins theory , to account for the contribution of the noncombinatorial entropy of mixing and the enthalpy of mixing to the Gibbs energy of mixing.

## 3.1.13 preferential sorption

## selective sorption

Equilibrium phenomenon, operative in polymer solutions, in multicomponent solvents, and in polymer  networks swollen  by  multicomponent  solvents,  that  produces  differences  in solvent composition in the polymer-containing region and in the pure solvent which is in thermodynamic equilibrium with that region.

## 3.1.14 selective solvent

Medium that is a solvent for at least one component of a mixture of polymers, or for at least one block of a block or graft polymer, but a non-solvent for the other component(s) or block(s).

## 3.1.15 co-solvency

Dissolution  of  a  polymer  in  a  solvent  comprising  more  than  one  component,  each component of which by itself is a non-solvent for the polymer.

## 3.1.16 solubility parameter (of a polymer) , δ , SI unit: Pa 1/2 = J 1/2 m -3/2

Parameter used in  predicting  the solubility of  non-electrolytes  (including  polymers)  in  a given solvent . For a substance B:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where  ∆vap E m is  the  molar  energy  of  vaporization  at  zero  pressure  and V m  is  the  molar volume.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note  2:  For  a  polymer,  the  value  of  the  solubility  parameter  is  usually  taken  to  be  the value  of  the  solubility  parameter  of  the  solvent  producing  the  solution  with  maximum intrinsic viscosity or maximum swelling of a network of the polymer.

Note  3:  For a substance of low molecular weight, the value of the solubility parameter can be estimated most reliably from the enthalpy of vaporization and the molar volume.

Note  4:  The  solubility  of  a  substance  B  can  be  related  to  the  square  of  the  difference between  the  solubility  parameters  for  supercooled  liquid  B  and  solvent  at  a  given temperature,  with  appropriate  allowances  for  entropy  of  mixing.  Thus  a  value  can  be estimated  from  the  solubility  of  the  solid  in  a  series  of  solvents  of  known  solubility parameter.

## 3.1.17 isopycnic

Adjective describing components of a multicomponent system with equal partial specific volumes.

## 3.2 Transport Properties

## 3.2.1 frictional coefficient , f , SI unit: kg s -1

Tensor correlating the frictional force, F, opposing the motion of a particle in a viscous fluid and the velocity u of this particle relative to the fluid.

Note: In the case of an isolated spherical particle in a viscous isotropic fluid, f is a scalar and F = fu.

## 3.2.2 hydrodynamically equivalent sphere

Hypothetical sphere, impenetrable to the surrounding medium, displaying in a hydrodynamic field the same frictional effect as an actual polymer molecule.

Note: The  size  of  a  hydrodynamically  equivalent  sphere  may  be  different  for  different types of motion of the macromolecule, e.g., for diffusion and for viscous flow.

## 3.2.3 hydrodynamic volume

Volume of a hydrodynamically equivalent sphere .

## 3.2.4 bead-rod model

Model simulating the hydrodynamic properties of a chain macromolecule consisting of a sequence  of  beads,  each  of  which  offers  hydrodynamic  resistance  to  the  flow  of  the surrounding medium and is connected to the next bead by a rigid rod which does not. The mutual orientation of the rods is random.

## 3.2.5 bead-spring model

Model simulating the hydrodynamic properties of a chain macromolecule consisting of a sequence  of  beads,  each  of  which  offers  hydrodynamic  resistance  to  the  flow  of  the surrounding  medium  and  is  connected  to  the  next  bead  by  a  spring  which  does  not contribute  to  the  frictional  interaction  but  which  is  responsible  for  the  elastic  and deformational properties of the chain. The mutual orientation of the springs is random.

## 3.2.6 freely draining

Adjective referring to a chain macromolecule the segments of which produce such small frictional effects when moving in a medium that the hydrodynamic field in the vicinity of a given  segment  is  not  affected  by  the  presence  of  other  segments.  Thus,  the  solvent  can flow virtually undisturbed through the domain occupied by a freely draining macromolecule.

## 3.2.7 non-draining

Adjective  describing  a  chain  macromolecule  that  behaves  in  a  hydrodynamic  field  as though  the  solvent  within  the  domain  of  the  macromolecule  were  virtually  immobilized with respect to the macromolecule.

## 3.2.8 partially draining

Adjective  describing  a  chain  macromolecule  that  behaves  in  a  hydrodynamic  field  as though  the  solvent  within  the  domain  of  the  macromolecule  were  progressively  more immobilized  with  respect  to  the  macromolecule  in  the  direction  from  its  outer  fringes inward.

Note:  A freely  draining macromolecule  and  a non-draining macromolecule  are  two extremes of the concept of a partially draining macromolecule.

## 3.2.9 streaming birefringence flow birefringence

Birefringence induced by flow in liquids, solutions and dispersions of optically anisotropic, anisometric or deformable molecules or particles due to a non-random orientation of the molecules or particles.

## 3.2.10 rotational diffusion

Process  by  which  the  equilibrium  statistical  distribution  of  the  overall  orientation  of molecules or particles is maintained or restored.

Note: Rotational diffusion may be compared to translational diffusion, through which the equilibrium statistical distribution of position in space is maintained or restored.

## 3.2.11 sedimentation coefficient , s , SI unit: s

Parameter characterizing the motion of a particle in a centrifugal field and defined as the velocity of motion u due to unit centrifugal acceleration, i.e., s = u /( r ω 2 ), where ω is the angular velocity and r the distance from the centre of rotation.

Note: The unit 10 -13 s is useful; this unit has been referred to as a 'svedberg' (Sv). 1 Sv = 10 -13 s =

0.1 ps.

## 3.2.12 sedimentation equilibrium

Equilibrium established in a centrifugal field when there is no net flux of any component across any plane perpendicular to the centrifugal force.

## 3.2.13 equilibrium sedimentation (method)

Method  by  which  the  distribution  of  the  concentration  of  the  solute  or  dispersed component  in  a  dilute  solution  or  dispersion  along  the  centrifuge  cell  is  measured  at sedimentation equilibrium , and the results are interpreted in terms of molar masses or their distribution, or both.

## 3.2.14 sedimentation velocity method

Method by which the velocity of motion of solute component(s) or dispersed particles is measured and the result is expressed in terms of its (their) sedimentation coefficient(s) .

## 3.2.15 Archibald's method

## TERMINOLOGY

direction  and  the  equations  characterizing  the sedimentation  equilibrium always  apply there, even though the system as a whole may be far from equilibrium.

Note: The use of the term 'approach to sedimentation equilibrium' for Archibald's method is discouraged, since it has a more general meaning.

## 3.2.18 relative viscosity increment , η i

Ratio of the difference between the viscosities of solution and solvent to the viscosity of the solvent, i.e., η i = ( η i -η s )/ η s. For definitions of symbols, see Definition 3.2.17.

Note: The use of the term 'specific viscosity' for this quantity  is  discouraged,  since  the relative viscosity increment does not have the attributes of a specific quantity.

## -1

Ratio of the relative viscosity increment to the mass concentration of the polymer, c , i.e., η i / c .

## 3.2.19 reduced viscosity , SI unit: m 3 kg viscosity number

Note: This quantity and those in Definitions 3.2.20 and 3.2.21 are neither viscosities nor pure numbers. The terms are to be looked on as traditional names. Any  replacement by consistent terminology would produce unnecessary confusion in the polymer literature.

## 3.2.20 inherent viscosity , inh, SI unit: m 3 kg -1

Ratio  of  the  natural  logarithm  of  the relative  viscosity to  the  mass  concentration  of  the polymer, c , i.e.,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where K and a are constants, the values of which depend on the nature of the polymer and solvent as well as on temperature, and M r ,  is  usually  one  of  the relative molecular-mass averages .

Note  1:  The use of this equation with the relative molecular mass (molecular weight) is recommended, rather than with molar mass (which has the dimension of mass divided by amount of substance), since in the latter case the constant K assumes awkward and variable dimensions owing to the fractional and variable nature of the exponent a .

Note  2:  Kuhn and Sakurada have also made important contributions and their names are sometimes included, as, for example, in the Kuhn-Mark-Houwink-Sakurada equation.

## 3.3 coherent elastic scattering of radiation

A beam of radiation traversing a medium may be attenuated and partially scattered. The definitions below are for those cases in which the attenuation of the incident beam is due only  to  scattering,  the  energy  of  scattering  quanta  is  the  same  as  that  of  quanta  in  the primary beam (elastic scattering) and phase relationships between independent scatterers are retained (coherent scattering). This section deals with light scattering (LS), small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). In light scattering the polarization  of  light  is  relevant;  plane-polarized  light  is  considered  here  only,  and  it  is called  vertically  polarized  (v)  if  the  electric  vector  of  the  beam  is  perpendicular  to  the plane  containing  the  source,  sample  and  detector,  and  horizontally  polarized  (h)  if  the electric vector lies in that plane. Unpolarized light is considered to be a mixture of equal parts of v and h light.

## 3.3.1 small particle

Particle much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation in the medium. In practice, all dimensions of a particle considered small must  be less than about one-twentieth of the wavelength employed.

## 3.3.2 large particle

Particle with dimensions comparable with the wavelength of the radiation in the medium or  larger.  In  practice  a  particle  must  be  treated  as  large,  if  its  largest  dimension  exceeds about one-twentieth of the wavelength employed.

## 3.3.3 scattering angle , θ angle of observation

## 3.3.6 refractive index increment , ∂ n/ ∂ c

Change of the solution refractive index, n , with solute concentration, c .

Note  1:  The solute concentration is most  frequently expressed in terms of  mass concentration, molality or volume fraction. If expressed in terms of mass concentration or molality, the corresponding refractive index increments are referred to as specific or molal refractive index increments, respectively.

Note  2:  Following use of the full name, the abbreviated name refractive increment may be used.

/f020

## 3.3.7 Rayleigh ratio , R ( θ ) or R θ /uniF02C/uniF020 , SI unit: m -1

/f020

Quantity used to characterize the scattered intensity at the scattering angle , θ ,  defined  as R ( θ ) = i θ r 2 /( I f V ), where I is the intensity of the incident radiation, i θ /f020 is the total intensity of scattered radiation observed at an angle θ /f020 and a distance r from the point of scattering and V is the scattering volume. The factor f takes account of polarization phenomena.

Note  1:  The value of f depends upon the type of radiation employed:

(i)  for  light  scattering,  depending  upon  the  polarization  of  the  incident  beam, f =  1  for vertically polarized light, f = cos 2 θ for horizontally polarized light, f = (1 + cos 2 θ )/2 for unpolarized light;

- (ii) for small-angle neutron scattering f = 1;
- (iii) for small-angle x-ray scattering f ≈ 1, if θ &lt; ca 5°.

Note  2:  In  physics,  the  factor, f ,  may  not  be  included  in  the  definition  of  the  Rayleigh ratio.

Note  3:  In small-angle neutron scattering, the term cross-section is often used instead of R ( θ ); the two quantities are identical.

## 3.3.8 excess Rayleigh ratio

Difference between the Rayleigh ratio for a dilute solution and for pure solvent.

Note: If the scattering intensity is not reduced to the Rayleigh ratio , the difference between the  scattering  intensities  for  a  dilute  solution  and  that  for  pure  solvent  is  named  'excess scattering'.

## 3.3.9 turbidity , τ

K depends on the solute, the temperature and the type of radiation employed.

Note: Several modifications of the Zimm plot are in frequent use; the most common one uses the excess scattering instead of the excess Rayleigh ratio .

## 3.3.12 Guinier plot

Diagrammatic  representation  of  data  on  scattering  from large  particles ,  obtained  at different  angles  but  at  the  same  concentration,  constructed  by  plotting  lg[ ∆ R ( θ )]  or lg[ P ( θ )] versus sin 2 ( θ /2)  or q 2 ,  and  (usually)  used  for  the  evaluation  of  the radius  of gyration , P ( θ ) the particle scattering function , θ , the scattering angle and q , the length of the scattering vector .

## 3.3.13 Kratky plot

Diagrammatic  representation  of  scattering  data  on large  particles ,  obtained  at  different angles  but  at  the  same  concentration,  constructed  by  plotting  sin 2 ( θ /2) ∆ R ( θ ) versus sin( θ /2),  or q 2 ∆ R ( θ )  versus q ,  and  used  for  the  determination  of  molecular  shape.

/f020

z ( θ 1 ,/uniF020 θ 2) = R ( θ 1 )/ R ( θ 2 ), θ 1 &gt; θ 2 /uniF02E.

Note: The angles must be specified; in light scattering it is customary to let θ 2 = 180° θ 1 , and, most frequently, θ 1 = 45° and θ 2 = 135°.

## 3.3.15 depolarization of scattered light

Phenomenon consequent upon the electric vectors of the incident and scattered beams being non-coplanar, such that light scattered from a vertically (horizontally) polarized incident beam contains a horizontal (vertical) component.

Note: The phenomenon is due primarily to the anisotropy of the polarizability of the scattering medium.

## 3.3.16 turbidimetric titration

## 3.4.5 extraction fractionation

Process  in  which  a  polymeric  material,  consisting  of  macromolecules  differing  in  some characteristic  affecting  their  solubility,  is  separated  from a  polymer-rich  phase into fractions  by  successively  increasing  the  solution  power  of  the  solvent,  resulting  in  the repeated  formation  of  a  two  phase  system  in  which  the  more  soluble  components concentrate in the polymer-poor phase .

## 3.4.6 size-exclusion chromatography ( SEC )
