## PREAMBLE

The  recommendations  embodied  in  this  document  are  concerned  with  the  terminology relating  to  the  structure  of  crystalline  polymers  and  the  process  of  macromolecular crystallization. The document is limited to systems exhibiting crystallinity in the classical sense of three-dimensionally periodic regularity. The recommendations deal primarily with crystal  structures  that  are  comprised  of  essentially  rectilinear,  parallel-packed  polymer chains, and secondarily, with those composed of so-called globular macromolecules. Since the  latter  are  biological  in  nature,  they  are  not  covered  in  detail  here.  In  general, macromolecular systems with mesophases are also omitted, but crystalline polymers with conformational disorder are included.

After a listing of some general definitions relating to crystalline polymers (Section 1), the subject is divided into sections dealing, successively, with local structural arrangements at  the  scale  of  a  few  bond  lengths  (Section  2),  morphological  aspects  (Section  3), molecular conformation within polymer crystals (Section 4) and, finally, kinetic aspects of crystallization (Section 5). An alphabetical index of terms is provided for the convenience of the reader.

This document relies on the basic definitions of terms in polymer science [1]. It was the second in a series published by the Commission on Macromolecular Nomenclature dealing with definitions of physical and physicochemical terms in the polymer field (for the first in the series, see Reference [2]).

## 1 GENERAL DEFINITIONS

## 1.1 crystallinity

Presence of three-dimensional order on the level of atomic dimensions.

Note: Crystallinity may be detected by diffraction techniques, heat of fusion measurements,  etc. Some  amount  of  disorder  within  the crystalline region is not incompatible with this concept.

## 1.2 crystalline polymer

Polymer showing crystallinity .

Note 1:  One- or two-dimensional order leads to mesophase structure.

Note 2:  The range of order may be as small as about 2 nm in one (or more) crystallographic direction(s) and is usually below 50 nm in at least one direction.

## 1.3 degree of crystallinity

Fractional amount of crystallinity in a polymer sample.

Note 1:  The assumption is made that the sample can be subdivided into a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase (the so-called two-phase model).

Note 2:  Both phases are assumed to have properties identical with those of their ideal states, with no influence of interfaces.

Note 3:  The degree of crystallinity may be expressed either as the mass fraction, w c , or as the volume fraction, φ c, the two quantities being related by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ρ and ρ c are the densities of the entire sample and of the crystalline fraction, respectively.

Note 4:  The degree of crystallinity can be determined by several experimental techniques; among the  most  commonly  used  are:  (i)  X-ray  diffraction,  (ii)  calorimetry,  (iii)  density measurements, and (iv) infrared spectroscopy (IR). Imperfections in crystals are not easily distinguished from the amorphous phase. Also, the various techniques may be affected to different  extents  by  imperfections  and  interfacial  effects.  Hence,  some  disagreement among  the  results  of  quantitative  measurements  of crystallinity by  different  methods  is frequently encountered.

Note 5:  The following expressions for w c, α , are recommended, where the subscript α specifies the particular experimental method used.

(i) By X-ray diffraction: the degree of crystallinity, w c,x, is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where I c and I a  are  the integrated intensities scattered over a suitable angular interval by the crystalline and the amorphous phases, respectively, and K x is a calibration constant. If the sample is anisotropic, a suitable average of the diffracted intensity in reciprocal space must be obtained.

(ii) By calorimetry: the degree of crystallinity, w c,h is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ∆ fus h is  the  specific  enthalpy  of  fusion  of  the  sample  and ∆ fus,c h is  the  specific enthalpy of fusion of the completely crystalline polymer over the same temperature range.

## TERMINOLOGY

The  value  of ∆ fus,c h may  be  obtained  by  extrapolating ∆ fus h to  the  density  of  the completely crystalline polymer , which in turn may be obtained from x-ray diffraction data. The specific enthalpies of fusion are temperature-dependent.

(iii) By density measurements: the degree of crystallinity, w c,d, is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ρ , ρ c and ρ a  are the densities of the sample, of the completely crystalline polymer and of the completely amorphous polymer, respectively.

(iv) By infrared spectroscopy: the degree of crystallinity, w c,i, is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where I o and I are, respectively, the incident and the transmitted intensities at the frequency of  the  absorption  band  due  to  the  crystalline  portion, a c  is  the  mass  decadic  absorption coefficient of the crystalline material and l is the thickness of the sample.

## 1.4 (polymer) crystal

Crystalline domain usually limited by well-defined boundaries.

Note 1:  Polymer crystals frequently do  not display the perfection that is usual for low-molar-mass substances.

Note 2:  Twinned polymer crystals are, sometimes, erroneously referred to as 'crystals'.

Note 3:  Polymer  crystals  that  can  be  manipulated  individually  are  often  called  (polymer) single crystals. A single crystal may contain different fold domains .

## 1.5 (polymer) crystallite

Small crystalline domain.

Note 1:  A crystallite may have irregular boundaries and parts of its constituent macromolecules may extend beyond its boundaries.

Note 2:  This definition is not identical with that used in classical crystallography.

## 1.6 unit cell

Smallest, regularly repeating material portion contained in a parallelepiped from which a crystal is formed by parallel displacements in three dimensions [3].

Note 1:  Unlike in the case of low-molar-mass substances, the unit cell of polymer crystals usually comprises only parts of the polymer molecules and the regularity of the periodic repetition may be imperfect.

Note 2:  In the case of parallel-chain crystals ,  the  chain  axis  is  usually  denoted  by c or, sometimes, b .

Note 3:  This definition applies to the so-called primitive unit cell. In practice, the effective unit cell may consist of more than one primitive unit cell.

## 1.7 molecular conformation

Conformation of the macromolecule as a whole.

Note 1:  In  the  polymer  literature,  molecular  conformation  is  sometimes  referred  to  as macroconformation.

## CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS

Note 2:  In molecular conformations involving parallel stems , the latter may be confined to the same crystal or may also extend over several crystals .

## 1.8 local conformation

Conformation of a macromolecule at the scale of the constitutional units. Note: In the polymer literature, local conformation is sometimes referred to as microconformation.

## 2 TERMINOLOGY RELATING TO LOCAL CONFORMATION AND STRUCTURAL ASPECTS [4]

## 2.1 chain axis

Straight line parallel to the direction of chain extension, connecting the centres of mass of successive blocks of chain units, each of which is contained within an identity period (see Fig. 1).

## 2.2 (chain) identity period (chain) repeating distance

Shortest distance along the chain axis for translational repetition of the chain structure.

Note 1:  The chain identity period is usually denoted by c .

Note 2:  An example is given in Fig. 1.

## 2.3 (chain) conformational repeating unit

Smallest structural unit of a polymer chain with a given conformation that is repeated along that chain through symmetry operations [5].

## 2.4 geometrical equivalence

Symmetry correspondence among units belonging to the same chain.

Note: The symmetry elements always bear a special relationship to the chain axis (see also the note, Definition 2.9).

## 2.5 equivalence postulate

Working hypothesis that the chain monomeric units are geometrically equivalent [6].

## 2.6 helix

Molecular  conformation of  a  spiral  nature,  generated  by  regularly  repeating  rotations around the backbone bonds of a macromolecule.

Note: An example is shown in Fig. 1.

## 2.7 helix residue

Smallest set of one or more successive configurational base units that generates the whole chain through helical symmetry.

## 2.8 class of helix

Number of skeletal chain atoms contained within the helix residue .

## 2.9 line repetition groups

Possible symmetries of arrays extending in one direction with a fixed repeating distance [3, 5, 7].

The chain axis is shown by the dashed line, and c is the chain identity period . Hydrogen atoms  are  omitted.  [From  P.  Corradini  and  P.  Ganis. Nuovo  Cimento ,  Suppl. 15 ,  96 (1960)].

Note: Linear polymer chains in the crystalline state must belong to one of the line repetition groups (see Table 1 for some examples). Permitted symmetry elements are: the identity operation (symbol 1); the translation along the chain axis (symbol t); the mirror plane orthogonal to the chain axis (symbol m) and that containing the chain axis (symbol d); the glide plane containing the chain axis (symbol c); the inversion centre, placed on the chain axis (symbol i); the two-fold axis orthogonal to the chain axis (symbol 2); the helical, or screw, symmetry where the axis of the helix coincides with the chain axis . In the latter case, the symbol is s(A * M / N ), where s stands for the screw axis, A is the class of the helix , * and / are separators, and M is the integral number of residues contained in N turns, corresponding to the identity period ( M and N must be prime to each other) [8, 9] (see Fig. 1). The class index A may be dropped if deemed unnecessary, so that the helix may also be simply denoted as s( M / N) [5, 7].

## 2.10 structural disorder

Any deviation from the ideal three-dimensional regularity of the polymer crystal structure.

Note: Examples of structural disorder in crystalline polymers are given in Table 2.

## 2.10.1 lattice distortion

Structural disorder resulting from misalignment of the unit cells within the crystals .

## 2.10.2 chain-orientational disorder

Structural disorder resulting from the statistical coexistence within the crystals of identical chains with opposite orientations.

Note: A typical example is provided by the up-down statistical coexistence of anticlined chains in the same crystal structure.

## 2.10.5 macromolecular isomorphism

Statistical  co-crystallization  of  different  constitutional  repeating  units,  which  may  either belong to the same copolymer chains (copolymer isomorphism) or originate from different homopolymer chains (homopolymer isomorphism).

Note: Isomorphism is a general term: in the strict sense, the crystal structure is essentially the  same  throughout  the  range  of  compositions;  in  isodimorphism  or  isopolymorphism, there are two or more crystal structures, respectively, depending on composition.

## 3 TERMINOLOGY RELATING TO MORPHOLOGICAL ASPECTS [9, 10]

## 3.1 lamellar crystal

Type of crystal with a large extension in two dimensions and a uniform thickness. Note: A lamellar crystal is usually of a thickness in the 5-50 nm range, and it may be found individually  or  in  aggregates.  The  parallel-chain stems intersect  the  lamellar  plane  at  an angle between 45° and 90°. The lamellae often have pyramidal shape owing to differences in the fold domains ; as a result, one can deduce different fold planes and fold surfaces from the lamellar morphology.

## 3.2 lath crystal

L amellar crystal prevailingly extended along one lateral dimension.

## 3.3 multilayer aggregate

Stack of lamellar crystals generated by spiral growth at one or more screw dislocations. Note: The axial displacement over a full turn of the screw (Burgers vector) is usually equal to one lamellar thickness.

## 3.4 long spacing

Average separation between stacked lamellar crystals .

Note: The long spacing is usually measured by small-angle x-ray or neutron diffraction.

## TERMINOLOGY

## 3.5 axialite

Multilayer aggregate, consisting of lamellar crystals splaying out from a common edge.

## 3.6 dendrite

Crystalline morphology produced by skeletal growth, leading to a 'tree-like' appearance.

## 3.7 fibrous crystal

Type of crystal significantly longer in one dimension than in either of the other two. Note: Fibrous crystals may comprise essentially extended chains parallel to the fibre axis; however, macroscopic polymer fibres containing chain-folded crystals are also known.

## 3.8 shish-kebab structure

Polycrystalline morphology of double habit consisting of fibrous crystals overgrown epitaxially by lamellar crystals , the stems of which are parallel to the fibre axis.

## 3.9 spherulite

Polycrystalline, roughly spherical morphology consisting of lath, fibrous or lamellar crystals emanating from a common centre.

Note: Space filling is achieved by branching, bending or both, of the constituent fibres or lamellae.

## 4 TERMINOLOGY RELATING TO MOLECULAR CONFORMATION WITHIN POLYMER CRYSTALS [9, 10]

## 4.1 tie molecule

Molecule that connects at least two different crystals .

## 4.2 stem

Crystallized, rodlike portion of a polymer chain connected to non-rodlike portions, or chain ends, or both.

## 4.3 chain fold

Conformational feature in which a loop connects two parallel stems belonging to the same crystal .

## 4.4 fold

Loop connecting two different stems in a folded chain.

## 4.5 fold plane

Crystallographic plane defined by a large number of stems that are connected by chain folds .

## 4.6 fold surface

Surface approximately tangential to the folds .

## 4.7 fold domain

Portion of a polymer crystal wherein the fold planes have the same orientation.

Note: The sectors of lamellar crystals frequently represent fold domains.

## 4.8 adjacent re-entry

Model of crystallinity in which chain folds regularly connect model adjacent stems .

## 4.9 switchboard model

Model of crystallinity in which the crystallized segments of a macromolecule belong to the same crystal , although the stems are connected randomly.

## 4.10 fringed-micelle model

Model of crystallinity in which the crystallized segments of a macromolecule belong predominantly to different crystals .

## 4.11 folded-chain crystal

Polymer crystal consisting predominantly of chains that traverse the crystal repeatedly by folding as they emerge at its external surfaces.

Note: The re-entry of the chain into the crystal is assumed to be adjacent or near-adjacent within the lattice.

## 4.12 parallel-chain crystal

Type of crystal resulting from parallel packing of stems , irrespective of the stems ' directional sense.

## 4.13 extended-chain crystal

Polymer crystal in which the chains are in an essentially fully extended conformation.

## 4.14 globular-chain crystal

Type of crystal comprised of macromolecules having globular conformations.

Note: Globular-chain crystals usually occur with globular proteins.

## 5 TERMINOLOGY RELATING TO CRYSTALLIZATION KINETICS [10, 11]

## 5.1 nucleation

Formation of the smallest crystalline entity, the further growth of which is thermodynamically favoured.

Note:  Nucleation  may  be  classified  as  primary  or  secondary.  Primary  nucleation  can  be homogeneous or heterogeneous; if heterogeneous nucleation is initiated by entities having the same composition as the crystallizing polymer, it is called self-nucleation. Secondary nucleation is also known as surface nucleation.

## 5.2 molecular nucleation

Initial crystallization of a small portion of a macromolecule,  after which  further crystallization is thermodynamically favoured.

Note: Molecular nucleation may give rise to a new crystal or increase the size of a pre-existing one.

## 5.3 Avrami equation

Equation, describing crystallization kinetics, of the form:

## CRYSTALLINE POLYMERS

## TERMINOLOGY

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where φ c is the crystalline volume fraction developed at time t and constant temperature, and K and n are suitable parameters.

Note 1: K is temperature-dependent.

Note 2:  According to the original theory, n should be an integer from 1 to 4, the value of which  should  depend  only  on  the  type  of  the  statistical  model;  however,  it  has  become customary to regard it as an adjustable parameter that may be non-integral.

Note 3:  The Avrami equation addresses the problem that crystals growing from different nuclei can overlap. Accordingly, the equation is sometimes called the 'overlap equation'.

## 5.4 primary crystallization

First stage of crystallization, considered to be ended when most of the spherulite surfaces impinge on each other.

Note: In isothermal crystallization, primary crystallization is often described by the Avrami equation .

## 5.5 secondary crystallization

Crystallization occurring after primary crystallization , usually proceeding at a lower rate.

## 5.6 reorganization

Molecular process by which (i) amorphous or poorly ordered regions of a polymer specimen become incorporated into crystals , or (ii) a change to a more stable crystal structure takes place, or (iii) defects within the crystals decrease.

Note 1: Secondary crystallization may be involved in the reorganization process.

Note 2:  Reorganization may result from annealing.

Note 3:  (i) and (iii) may also be called crystal perfection.

## 5.7 recrystallization

Reorganization proceeding through partial melting.

Note: Recrystallization is  likely  to  result  in  an  increase  in  the degree of crystallinity ,  or crystal perfection, or both.

## 5.8 segregation

Rejection of a fraction of macromolecules, or of impurities, or both, from growing crystals . Note:  The  rejected  macromolecules  are  usually  those  of insufficient  relative  molecular mass, or differing in constitution or configuration (e.g., branching, tacticity, etc.).
