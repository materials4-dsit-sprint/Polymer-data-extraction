## 1 PREAMBLE

This document provides definitions of the basic terms that are widely used in the field of liquid crystals and in polymer science (See references 1-39). It is the first publication of the Commission on Macromolecular Nomenclature dealing specifically with liquid crystals.

The recommendations made, resulting from the joint effort of the IUPAC Commission IV.1  Working  Party  and  members  of  the  International  Liquid  Crystal  Society,  are concerned with terminology relating to low-molar-mass and liquid-crystal polymers. Since much of the terminology is common to both classes of liquid crystals, this document has not  been  divided  into  sections  dealing  separately  with  these  two  classes  of  substances. After some general definitions (Section 2), there are sections dealing successively with the structures  and  optical  textures  of  liquid  crystals  (Sections  3  and  4),  their  physical characteristics  (including  electro-optical  and  magneto-optical  properties)  (Section  5)  and finally liquid-crystal polymers (Section 6). An alphabetical index of terms and a glossary of recommended symbols are provided for the convenience of the reader.

Implied definitions, occurring in Notes to the main definitions, are indicated by using bold type for the terms so defined.

## 2 GENERAL DEFINITIONS

## 2.1 mesomorphic state

## mesomorphous state

State of matter in which the degree of molecular order is intermediate between the perfect three-dimensional, long-range positional and orientational order found in solid crystals and the absence of long-range order found in isotropic liquids, gases and amorphous solids.

Note 1:  The term mesomorphic state has a more general meaning than liquid-crystal state , but the two are often used as synonyms.

Note 2:  The  term  is  used  to  describe  orientationally  disordered  crystals,  crystals  with molecules  in  random  conformations  (i.e.,  conformationally  disordered  crystals),  plastic crystals and liquid crystals .

Note 3:  A  compound  which  can  exist  in  a  mesomorphic  state  is  usually  called  a mesomorphic compound .

Note 4:  A vitrified substance in the mesomorphic state is called a mesomorphic glass and is obtained, for example, by rapid quenching or by crosslinking.

## 2.2 liquid-crystal state ( LC state )

## liquid-crystalline state

Mesomorphic state having long-range orientational order and either partial positional order or complete positional disorder.

Note 1:  In a LC state, a substance combines the properties of a liquid (e.g., flow, ability to form droplets) and a crystalline solid (e.g., anisotropy of some physical properties).

Note 2:  A LC state occurs between the crystalline solid and the isotropic liquid states on varying, for example, the temperature.

## 2.2.1 liquid-crystalline phase ( LC phase )

Phase occurring over a definite temperature range within the L C state .

## 2.3 liquid crystal ( LC )

Substance in the L C state .

Note: A pronounced anisotropy in the shapes and interactions of molecules, or molecular aggregates is necessary for the formation of liquid crystals.

## 2.4 mesophase

Phase occurring over a definite range of temperature, pressure or concentration within the mesomorphic state .

## 2.4.1 enantiotropic mesophase

Mesophase that is thermodynamically stable over a definite temperature or pressure range. Note:  The  range  of  thermal  stability  of  an  enantiotropic  mesophase  is  limited  by  the melting  point  and  the clearing  point of  an L C compound  or  by  any  two  successive mesophase transitions.

## 2.4.2 thermotropic mesophase

Mesophase formed by heating a solid or cooling an isotropic liquid, or by heating or cooling a thermodynamically stable mesophase at constant pressure.

Note 1:  The  adjective  'thermotropic'  describes  a  change  of  phase  with  a  change  of temperature.  'Thermotropic'  may  also  be  used  to  qualify  types  of mesophase (e.g., thermotropic nematic ).

Note 2:  Analogous changes can also occur on varying the pressure at constant temperature in which case the mesophase may be termed barotropic mesophase .

## 2.4.3 lyotropic mesophase

Mesophase formed by dissolving an amphiphilic mesogen in a suitable solvent, under appropriate conditions of concentration, temperature and pressure.

Note 1:  The  essential  feature  of  a  lyotropic  liquid  crystal  is  the  formation  of  molecular aggregates  or  micelles  as  a  result  of  specific  interactions  involving  the  molecules  of  the amphiphilic mesogen and those of the solvent.

Note 2:  The  mesomorphic  character  of  a  lyotropic  mesophase  arises  from  the  extended, ordered arrangement of the solvent-induced micelles. Hence, such mesophases should be regarded as based not on the structural arrangement of individual molecules (as in a nonamphiphilic or a thermotropic mesophase ), but on the arrangement within multimolecular domains .

## 2.4.4 amphitropic compound

Compound that can exhibit thermotropic as well as lyotropic mesophases .

Note:  Examples  are  potassium  salts  of  unbranched  alkanoic  acids,  lecithin,  certain polyisocyanates, cellulose derivatives with side-chains, such as (2-hydroxypropyl)cellulose, and cyanobiphenyl derivatives of alkyl(triethyl)ammonium bromide.

## 2.4.5 monotropic mesophase

Metastable mesophase that  can  be  formed  by  supercooling  an  isotropic  liquid  or  an enantiotropic mesophase at  a  given pressure to a temperature below the melting point of the crystal.

Note: Monotropic transition temperatures are indicated by placing parentheses, (), around the values.

## 2.5 transition temperature , T XY, SI Unit: K

Temperature at which the transition from mesophase X to mesophase Y occurs.

Note: Mesophase X should be stable at lower temperatures than phase Y. For example, the nematic -isotropic transition temperature would be denoted as T NI.

## 2.6 clearing point , T cl or T i, SI Unit: K clearing temperature isotropization temperature

Temperature at which the transition between the mesophase with the highest temperature range and the isotropic phase occurs.

Note:  The  term  should  only  be  used  when  the  identity  of  the mesophase preceding  the isotropic phase is unknown.

## 2.7 virtual transition temperature

Transition temperature that  cannot  be  measured  directly,  determined  by  extrapolation  of transition lines in binary phase diagrams to 100% of that particular component.

## TERMINOLOGY

Note 1:  A virtual transition temperature lies outside the temperature range over which the (meso) phase implied can be observed experimentally.

Note 2:  A virtual transition temperature is not well defined; it will, for example, depend on the nature of the liquid-crystal components used to construct the phase diagram.

Note 3:  A  virtual transition  temperature is  indicated  by  placing  square  brackets,  [  ], around its value.

## 2.8 transitional entropy , ∆ XY S , SI Unit: J K -1 mol -1

Change in entropy on transition from phase X to phase Y.

Note 1:  The  transitional  entropy  reflects  the  change  in  order,  both  orientational  and translational, at the phase transition.

Note 2:  Phase X should be stable at lower temperatures than phase Y.

Note 3:  Numerical  values  of  the  molar  entropy  of  transition  should  be  given  as  the dimensionless quantity ∆ XY S/R where R is the gas constant.

## 2.9 divergence temperature , T * , SI Unit: K pre-transitional temperature

Temperature at which the orientational correlations in an isotropic phase diverge.

Note 1:  The divergence temperature is the lowest limit of metastable supercooling of the isotropic phase.

Note 2:  The divergence occurs at the point where the isotropic phase would be expected to undergo  a second-order transition to the liquid-crystal phase, were  it not for the intervention of a first-order transition to the liquid-crystal phase.

Note 3:  The divergence temperature for nematogens can be measured by using the Kerr effect or Cotton-Mouton effect or by light-scattering experiments.

Note 4: T * occurs  below  the  clearing  temperature,  usually  by  about  1  K  in  isotropic-tonematic transitions and increases to at least 10 K for isotropic-to-smectic transitions.

## 2.10 mesogenic group mesogenic unit mesogenic moiety

Part of a molecule or macromolecule endowed with sufficient anisotropy in both attractive and  repulsive  forces  to  contribute  strongly  to L C  mesophase ,  or,  in  particular,  to L C mesophase formation in low-molar-mass and polymeric substances.

Note 1:  ' Mesogen ic'  is  an  adjective  that  in  the  present  document  applies  to  molecular moieties that are structurally compatible with the formation of L C phases in the molecular system in which they exist.

Note 2: Mesogen ic groups occur in both low-molar-mass and polymeric compounds.

Note 3:  The majority of mesogen ic groups consist of rigid rod-like or disc-like molecular moieties.

## 2.11 mesogen

mesogenic compound

## mesomorphic compound

Compound that under suitable conditions of temperature, pressure and concentration can exist as a mesophase , or, in particular as a L C phase .

Note 1:  When  the  type  of mesophase formed  is  known,  more  precisely  qualifying terminology can be used, e.g., nematogen , smectogen and chiral nematogen .

Note 2:  When  more  than  one  type  of mesophase can  be  formed,  more  than  one qualification could apply to the same compound and then the general term mesogen should be used.

## 2.11.1 amphiphilic mesogen

Mesogen composed of molecules consisting of two parts of contrasting character that are hydrophilic and hydrophobic or lipophobic and lipophilic.

Note 1:  Examples  of  amphiphilic mesogens  are  soaps, detergents  and  some  block copolymers.

Note 2:  Under  suitable  conditions  of  temperature  and  concentration,  the  similar  parts  of amphiphilic molecules cluster together to form aggregates or micelles.

## 2.11.2 non-amphiphilic mesogen

Mesogen that is not of the amphiphilic type.

Note 1:  At one time it was thought that a non-amphiphilic molecule had to be long and rod-like for mesophase formation, but it has now been established that molecules of other types  and  shapes,  for  example,  disc-like  and  banana-shaped  molecules,  may  also  form mesophases . (See ref. 6).

Note 2:  A  selection  of  the  types  of  non-amphiphilic mesogens is  given  in  Definitions 2.11.2.1-2.11.2.8.

<!-- image -->

Note 2:  The  adjective  'discotic'  is  also  employed  to  describe  the nematic mesophases formed by discotic mesogens . The mesophases formed by a columnar stacking of disc-like molecules are described as columnar mesophases .

## 2.11.2.3 pyramidic mesogen conical or cone-shaped mesogen bowlic mesogen

Mesogen composed of molecules each having an elongated rigid core with several flexible chains attached to the end(s).

Note 1:  The flexible chains are usually aliphatic.

Note 2:  The numbers of flexible chains at the ends of the core can be indicated by using the term m,n -polycatenary mesogen .

## 2.11.2.9 liquid-crystal oligomer

## mesogenic oligomer

Mesogen constituted of molecules, each with more than one mesogenic group .

Note 1:  The mesogenic groups usually have identical structures.

Note 2:  A  liquid-crystal  dimer  or mesogen ic  dimer  is  sometimes  known  as  a  twin mesogen .  Use  of  the  terms  'di mesogen ic  compounds'  and  'Siamese-twin mesogen '  for liquid-crystal dimer or mesogenic dimer is not recommended.

Note 3:  ExampIes of mesogen ic dimers are: (a) fused twin mesogen , where the mesogenic groups are  linked  rigidly  by  a  (usually  fused)  ring  system,  (b)  ligated  twin mesogen ,  in

wherein -(CH2)8- is the flexible spacer linking the two mesogenic groups .

Note 4:  A  liquid-crystal  dimer  with  different mesogenic  groups linked  by  a spacer is known as an asymmetric liquid-crystal dimer .

Note 5:  A liquid-crystal dimer with flexible hydrocarbon chains having an odd number of carbon atoms is called an odd-membered  liquid-crystal  dimer , whilst one with hydrocarbon chains having an even number of carbon atoms is called an even-membered liquid-crystal dimer .

## 3 TYPES OF MESOPHASE

## 3.1 mesophases of calamitic mesogens

## 3.1.1 uniaxial nematic mesophase , N or Nu nematic

Mesophase formed by a non-chiral compound or by the racemate of a chiral compound in which  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  molecular  centers  of  mass  is  devoid  of  long-range positional order and the molecules are, on average, orientationally ordered about a common axis defined as the director and represented by the unit vector n .

Note 1:  See Fig. 1 for an illustration of the molecular organization in a uniaxial nematic mesophase.

Note 2:  The unit vector, n , is defined in 3.1.1.1. (See also Fig. 1.)

Note 3:  The direction of n is usually arbitrary in space.

Note 4:  The extent of the positional correlations for the molecules in a nematic phase is comparable to that of an isotropic phase although the distribution function is necessarily anisotropic.

Note 5:  From a crystallographic point of view, the uniaxial nematic structure is characterised  by  the  symbol  D ∞ h  in  the  Schoenflies  notation  ( ∞ /mm in the  International System).

Note 6:  Since  the  majority  of  nematic  phases  are  uniaxial,  if  no  indication  is  given,  a nematic phase is assumed to be uniaxial but, when there is the possibility of a biaxial as well a uniaxial nematic, a uniaxial phase should be denoted as Nu.

## 3.1.1.1 director , n

Local symmetry axis for the singlet, orientational distribution of the molecules of a mesophase .

Note 1:  The director is defined as a unit vector, but directions +n and -n are arbitrary.

Note 2:  In uniaxial nematics , formed by compounds consisting of either rod-like or disclike molecules, the mean direction of the effective molecular symmetry axis coincides with the director .

Note 3:  The director also coincides with a local symmetry axis of any directional property of the mesophase , such as the refractive index or magnetic susceptibility.

## 3.1.2 cybotactic groups

Assembly of molecules in a nematic mesophase having a short-range smectic-like array of the constituent molecules.

Note: Two types of short-range smectic-like structures are possible. One is analogous to a smectic A mesophase where the molecules tend to lie along a layer normal and the other is like a smectic C mesophase where the molecules tend to be oblique with respect to a layer normal.  See  Fig.  2  for  illustrations  of  the  molecular  arrangements  in  the smectic  A type structure and the smectic C type structure.

## TERMINOLOGY

## 3.1.3 chiral nematic mesophase , N*

chiral nematic cholesteric mesophase

cholesteric

Mesophase with a helicoidal superstructure of the director , formed by chiral , calamitic or discotic molecules  or  by  doping  a uniaxial  nematic host  with  chiral  guest  molecules  in which the local director n precesses around a single axis.

See  Fig.  3  for  an  illustration  of  the  helicoidal  molecular  distribution  in  a  chiral  nematic mesophase.

Note 1:  Locally, a chiral nematic mesophase is similar to a uniaxial nematic, except for the precession of the director n about the axis, Z .

Note 2:  The director is periodic along Z with the pitch P of the helical structure equal to a turn of the local director n by 2 π .

Note 3:  Chiral nematic mesophases exhibit Bragg scattering of circularly polarised light at a wavelength λ R proportional to the pitch P ( λ R = &lt; n &gt; P , where &lt; n &gt; is the mean refractive index).

Note 4:  The director precession in a chiral nematic mesophase is spontaneous and should be  distinguished  from  an  induced  twisted  structure  produced  by  a  mechanical  twist  of  a nematic mesophase between confining surfaces.

Note 5:  The  term  chiral  nematic  mesophase  or  chiral  nematic  is  preferred  to  cholesteric mesophase or cholesteric.

## 3.1.4 blue phase , ( BP )

Mesophase with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of helical director axes leading to frustrated  structures  with  defects  arranged  on  a  lattice  with  cubic  symmetry  and  lattice constants of the order of the wavelength of visible light.

Note 1:  See Fig. 4 for a possible model for a BP.

Note 2:  The  name  'blue  phase'  derives  historically  from  the  optical  Bragg  reflection  of blue  light  but,  because  of  larger  lattice  constants,  BPs  can  reflect  visible  light  of  longer wavelengths.

Note 3:  With chiral nematic substances forming chiral nematic mesophases of short pitch (&lt;700 nm), up to three blue phases occur in a narrow temperature range between the chiral nematic phase and the isotropic phase.

Note 4:  A BP is optically isotropic and exhibits a Bragg reflection of circularly polarised light.

Note 5:  Two BPs of different cubic symmetry (space group I 4132 for BP I and P 4232 for BP II) are presently known, together with a third (BPIII) of amorphous structure. Several other  BPs  of  different  cubic  symmetry exist but only in the presence of external electric fields.

## 3.1.5 smectic mesophase, ( Sm )

Mesophase that has the molecules arranged in layers with a well-defined layer spacing or periodicity.

Note 1:  There  are  several  types  of  smectic  mesophases,  characterised  by  a  variety  of molecular arrangements within the layers.

Note 2:  Although  the  total  number  of  smectic  mesophases  cannot  be  specified,  the following  types  have  been  defined:  SmA,  SmB,  SmC,  SmF  and  SmI.  The  alphabetical order of suffixes merely indicates an order of discovery.

Note 3:  The  classification  of  SmD  as  smectic  is  largely  a  consequence  of  history,  and should be discontinued (see Definition 3.1.9).

Z

Note 4:  At one time, a number of mesophases were identified as smectic on the basis of their optical  textures ,  but  they  are  in  fact  soft  crystals  characterised  by  very  low  yield stresses.  Hence,  these  three-dimensionally  ordered  phases  should  no  longer  be  called smectic  mesophases.  They  are  akin  to  plastic  crystals  with  some  elementary  long-range order and are referred to by the letters E, J, G, H, and K.

Note 5:  Tilted  smectic  mesophases  formed  by  chiral  compounds  or  containing  chiral mixtures  are  designated  by  the  superindex * (SmC * ,  SmF * ,  etc.).  (See,  for  example, Definition 3.1.5.1.3.)

## 3.1.5.1 smectic mesophases with unstructured layers

## 3.1.5.1.1  smectic A mesophase , ( SmA )

Smectic  mesophase involving  a  parallel  arrangement  of  the  molecules  within  layers  in which the long axes of the molecules tend to be perpendicular to the layer planes and the molecular centers of mass have no long-range positional order parallel to the layer planes.

- Note 1:  See Fig. 5 for the molecular organization in a smectic A mesophase
- Note 2:  Each layer approximates to a true two-dimensional liquid. The system is optically uniaxial and the optic axis, Z , is normal to the layer planes.
- Note 3:  The directions + Z and Z are interchangeable.
- Note 4:  The structure of a smectic A mesophase is characterised by the symbol D ∞ h in the Schoenflies notation ( ∞ , 2 in the International System).
- Note 5:  The lyotropic equivalent  of  a  smectic  A  mesophase  is  known  as  a lamellar mesophase ;  where  layers  of  amphiphilic  molecules  are  separated  by  layers  of  solvent, normally water, or by oil in an inverse lamellar mesophase .

Note 6:  A smectic A-phase containing a chiral molecule or dopant, can be called a chiral smectic  A-phase.  The  recommended  symbol  is  SmA * wherein  the  ( * )  indicates  that  the macroscopic structure of the mesophase is chiral.

Fig. 5. Illustrating the structure of a smectic A mesophase.

## 3.1.5.1.2  smectic C mesophase, ( SmC )

Analogue of a smectic A mesophase involving  an  approximately  parallel  arrangement  of the molecules within layers in which the director is tilted with respect to the layer normal and the molecular centers-of-mass have no long-range positional order parallel to the layer planes (See Fig. 6).

Note 1:  See  Fig.  6  for  an  illustration  of  the  molecular  organization  in  a  smectic  C mesophase.

Note 2:  The physical properties of a smectic C mesophase are those of a biaxial crystal.

• Tilt Angle

Note 3:  The smectic C structure corresponds to monoclinic symmetry characterised by the symbol  C2h,  in  the  Schoenflies  notation  and  the  space  group t 2/ m in  the  International System.

Note 4:  The tilt direction varies in a random manner from layer to layer in conventional smectic  C mesophases .  However  it  can  alternate  from  layer  to  layer,  as  in an  antiferroelectric  chiral  smectic  C  mesophase (see  Definition  5.9,  Note  7)  and  in  the  smectic  C mesophase formed by certain liquid crystal dimers with an odd-number of carbon atoms in the spacers . The recommended symbol for this type of mesophase is SmCa.

<!-- image -->

## 3.1.5.1.3  chiral smectic C mesophase, ( SmC * )

Smectic C mesophase in which the tilt direction of the director in each successive layer is rotated through a certain angle relative to the preceding one so that a helical structure of a constant pitch is formed.

Note 1:  See Fig. 7 for an illustration of the molecular organization in a chiral smectic C mesophase.

Note 2:  The ( * ) in SmC * and analogous notations indicate, as in 3.1.5.1.2 (Note 6), that the macroscopic  structure  of  the mesophase is  chiral.  However,  it  is  also  used  simply  to indicate  that  some  of  the  constituent  molecules  are  chiral  even  though  the  microscopic structure may not be.

Note 3:  A SmC * mesophase is formed by chiral compounds or mixtures containing chiral compounds.

Note 4:  Locally, the structure of the chiral smectic C mesophase is essentially the same as that of the achiral smectic C mesophase except that there is a precession of the tilt direction about a single axis. It has the symmetry C2 in the Schoenflies notation.

Note 5:  This  chiral  smectic  C  phase  is  also  known  as  the ferroelectric chiral  smectic  C phase.

Note 6:  The  helix  can  be  unwound  by  surface  forces  to  give  a  surface-stabilised  SmC * which has a macroscopic polarization.

## 3.1.5.2 hexatic smectic mesophase

Smectic mesophase with in-plane short-range positional molecular order, weakly coupled two-dimensional layers and long-range bond orientational molecular order.

Note: There are three types of hexatic smectic mesophases :  smectic  B (SmB), smectic F (SmF) and smectic I (SmI). Here, the term 'hexatic' may be omitted because it is implicit for this group of smectic mesophases .

## TERMINOLOGY

## 3.1.5.2.1  smectic B mesophase, ( SmB )

Hexatic  smectic  mesophase in  which  the director is  perpendicular  to  the  layers  with  the long-range hexagonal bond-orientational order.

Note 1:  See  Fig.  8  for  an  illustration  of  the  molecular  organization  in  a  smectic  B mesophase.

- Note 2:  Positional  molecular  order  does  not  propagate  over  distances  larger  than  a  few tens  of  nanometers  but  bond  orientational  molecular  order  extends  over  macroscopic distances within and across layers.
- Note 3:  By contrast with a smectic B mesophase, a crystal B mesophase has correlations of  positional  order  (hexagonal)  in  three  dimensions,  i.e.,  correlations  of  position  occur within and between layers.

Note 1:  Originally, these mesophases were designated as smectic, but further investigations have demonstrated their three-dimensional character.

Note 2:  In the crystal B and E mesophases , the molecular long axes are essentially parallel to the normals to the layer planes while in the G, H, J and K mesophases they are tilted with respect to the layer normals.

- Note 3:  The E, J and K phases have herringbone organizations of the molecular short axes and so the mesophases are optically biaxial.

## 3.1.8 induced mesophase

Particular mesophase formed by a binary mixture, the components of which do not separately form mesophases , with the particular mesophase existing above the melting points of both components.

Note 1:  The  formation  of  an  induced  mesophase  usually  results  from  an  attractive interaction between unlike species, the strength of which exceeds the mean of the strengths of the interactions between like species.

Note 2:  Examples of such interactions that have been noted are dipolar/non-polar, chargetransfer and quadrupolar.

Note 3: Mesophases can  also  be  induced  when  the  free-volume  between  the  large, irregular  molecules  of  one  component  is  filled  by  the  smaller  molecules  of  the  second component.  Such mesophases have  been  called  filled smectic  mesophases although  the term 'induced' is recommended.

Note 4:  A monotropic mesophase can  be  stabilised  in  a  mixture  when,  as  a  result  of melting-point depression, a metastable mesophase becomes stabilised. Such a mesophase is distinct from an induced mesophase.

## 3.1.9 cubic mesophase , ( Cub )

Mesophase with  an  overall  three-dimensional  order  of  cubic  symmetry  in  which  each micellar  unit  cell  contains  several  hundred  molecules  in  random  configurations,  as  in  a liquid.

Note 1:  The mesophase formerly  designated  as smectic D  (see  Definition  3.1.5,  Note  3) belongs to this class.

Note 2:  A  cubic  mesophase  is  optically  isotropic;  it  may  be  distinguished  from  an isotropic liquid or a homeotropic phase by the fact that the optically-black isotropic phase or  homeotropic phase nucleates in the birefringent SmC phase in straight-edged squares, rhombi, hexagons and rectangles.

- Note 3:  A  cubic  mesophase  may  be  formed  by  rod-like  molecules  with  strong,  specific intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, between them. However, they are also found in polycatenary compounds where there are no specific, strong interactions.

Note 4:  Cubic mesophases have  long  been  known  in  thermotropic  salt-like  compounds and in lyotropic liquid-crystals.

Note 5:  There  are  several  types  of thermotropic and lyotropic cubic mesophases ,  with different symmetry and miscibility properties; when the space groups of these are known, they should be included in parentheses after the term 'Cub'.

## 3.2 mesophases of disc-like mesogens discotic mesophases discotics

## 3.2.1 discotic nematic mesophase , N discotic nematic

Nematic  mesophase in  which  disc-shaped  molecules,  or  the  disc-shaped  portions  of macromolecules, tend to align with their symmetry axes parallel to each other and have a random spatial distribution of their centers of mass.

Note 1:  See  Fig.  13  for  an  illustration  of  the  molecular  arrangement  in  a discotic mesophase .

Note 2:  The  symmetry  and  structure  of  a nematic mesophase formed  from  disc-like molecules is identical to that formed from rod-like molecules. It is recommended therefore, that  the  subscript  'D'  is  removed  from  the  symbol  'ND',  often  used  to  denote  a nematic formed from disc-like molecules.

Note 3:  In some cases the discotic nematic mesophase is formed by compounds that do not have molecules of discotic shape (for example, phasmidic compounds, salt-like materials and oligosaccharides).

Note 4: Chiral discotic nematic mesophases , N * , also exist.

Mesophase in  which disc-shaped molecules, the disc-shaped moieties of macromolecules or  wedge-shaped  molecules  assemble  themselves  in  columns  packed  parallel  on  a  twodimensional lattice, but without long-range positional correlations along the columns.

## TERMINOLOGY

Note:  Depending  on  the  order  in  the  molecular  stacking  in  the  columns  and  the  twodimensional lattice symmetry of the columnar packing, the columnar mesophases may be classified  into  three  major  classes:  hexagonal,  rectangular  and  oblique  (see  Definitions 3.2.2.1. to 3.2.2.3).

## 3.2.2.1 columnar hexagonal mesophase, ( Colh )

Columnar mesophase characterised by a hexagonal packing of the molecular columns.

Note 1:  See Fig. 14 for an illustration of the molecular arrangement in a Colh mesophase.

Note 2:  Hexagonal mesophases are  often  denoted  Colh o or  Colh d where  h  stands  for hexagonal and o and d refer to the range of positional correlations along the column axes: o stands  for  ordered  and  d  for  disordered.  The  use  of  the  subscripts  o  and  d  should  be discontinued.  ln  both  cases,  the  ordering  is  liquid-like,  only  the  correlation  lengths  are different.

Fig. 14. Illustrating the molecular organization of a columnar hexagonal mesophase.

<!-- image -->

Note 3:  The relevant space group of a Colh mesophase is P 6/ mmm (equivalent to P 6/ m 2/ m in the International System and point group D6h in the Schoenflies notation).

Note 4:  The lyotropic equivalent  of  a  columnar  hexagonal  mesophase  is  known  as  a hexagonal  mesophase ;  in  it,  columns  of  amphiphilic  molecules  are  surrounded  by  the solvent, normally water, or an oil in an inverse hexagonal mesophase .

Note 1:  See Figs 15a-c for illustrations of molecular arrangements in columnar rectangular mesophases.

Note 2:  The  average  orientation  of  the  planes  of  the  molecular  discs  is  not  necessarily normal to the column axes.

Note 3:  Depending  on  the  plane  space-group  symmetries,  three  rectangular mesophases are distinguished (See Fig. 15a-c).

Note 4:  There also exist chiral columnar rectangular mesophases, with the molecular discs tilted periodically in the columns and with the tilt directions changing regularly down the columns.

## 3.2.2.3 columnar oblique mesophase , ( Colob )

Columnar mesophase characterised by a liquid-like molecular order along the column, in which the columns are arranged with an oblique packing.

Note 1:  See  Fig.  15d  for  an  illustration  of  the  molecular  arrangement  in  a  columnar oblique mesophase.

Note 2:  The average of the planes of the molecular discs is not necessarily normal to the columnar axes.

- Note 3:  The plane space-group symmetry of a Colob mesophase is P1 (see Fig. 15d).

Note 4:  There also exist chiral columnar oblique mesophases, with the tilt directions of the columnar discs varying regularly along the columns.

## 3.3 biaxial mesophase

Mesophase composed of board-like molecules in which there are long-range orderings of both the longer and the shorter molecular axes.

Note 1:  The recommended subscript to designate a biaxial mesophase is: b

Note 2:  A biaxial mesophase has three orthogonal directors denoted by the unit vectors l, m and n.

Note 3:  The tensorial properties of a biaxial mesophase have biaxial symmetry unlike the uniaxial symmetries of, for example, the nematic and smectic A mesophases .

Note 4:  The biaxiality of the phase does not result from tilted structures as, for example, in a smectic C mesophase .

Note 5:  Distinct  biaxial mesophases are  created  when  the  molecular  centers  of  mass  are correlated within the layers. Such mesophases have been proposed for board-like polymers and have been called sanidic mesophases .

Note 6: Sanidic structures are analogous to the columnar mesophases formed by disc-like molecules.

(d)

## 3.3.1 biaxial nematic mesophase , Nb biaxial nematic

Mesophase in which the long axes of the molecules are, on average, orientationally ordered about  a  common director and  one  of  the  shorter  molecular  axes  is  ordered,  on  average, about a second, orthogonal director .

Note 1:  See Fig. 16 for an illustration of the molecular arrangement in a Nb mesophase.

Note 2:  From a crystallographic point of view, the biaxial nematic structure is characterised  by  the  symbol  D2h  in  the  Schoenflies  notation  (2/ m , m in  International System).

Note 3:  In lyotropic systems,  biaxial  nematic  mesophases  have  been  identified  from  the biaxial symmetry of their tensorial properties.

Note 4:  The  situation  for thermotropic  calamitic systems  is  less  clear  and  for  some compounds claimed to form a Nb, detailed investigations have found the mesophase to be of type Nu.

Note 5:  A biaxial nematic has the same structure as a disordered sanidic mesophase (see Definition  3.4,  Note  2);  it  is  recommended  that  the  latter  name  be  discontinued  and  the name biaxial nematic be used.

## 3.4 sanidic mesophase, Σ

Mesophase in  which board-shaped molecules  assemble  in  stacks  packed  parallel  to  one another on a one- or two-dimensional lattice (see Figs. 17 and 18).

Note 1:  See Figs. 17 and 18 for examples of sanidic mesophases .

Note 2:  Short board-like shaped molecules usually form biaxial nematic mesophases . It is recommended that the use of the term disordered sanidic mesophases for such mesophases be discontinued (see Definition 3.3.1, Note 5).

- Note 3:  Rotation of the molecules around their long axes is considerably hindered.

## 3.4.1 rectangular sanidic mesophase , Σ r

Mesophase with a helicoidal supramolecular structure in which blocks of molecules, with a local structure of the smectic A type, have their layer normals rotated with respect to each other and are separated by screw dislocations.

Note 1:  See  Fig.  19  for  an  illustration  of  the  molecular  arrangement  of  a  TGBA * mesophase.

Note 2:  The  TGBA * mesophase  is  formed  by  a  chiral  compound  or  a  mixture  of  chiral compounds.

- Note 3:  Two TGBA * structures are possible; in one, the number of blocks corresponding to a rotation of the layer normal by 2 π is an integer, while in the other, it is a non-integer.

Note 4:  A  TGBA * is  found  in  a  phase  diagram  between smectic  A and chiral nematic mesophases or between a smectic A mesophase and an isotropic phase.

Note 5:  The temperature range of existence of a TGBA * mesophase is typically several K.

Mesophase of helicoidal supermolecular structure in which blocks of molecules with a local structure of the smectic C type, have their layer normals rotated with respect to each other and are separated by screw dislocations.

Note 1:  Two forms of TGBC * mesophase are possible: in one form the director within the layer is tilted and rotates coherently through the layers in a block as in a chiral smectic C mesophase , while in the other form the director within a block is simply tilted with respect to the layer normal as in a smectic C mesophase .

Note 2:  In the case of a short pitch, when P is less than the wavelength λ , the macroscopic extraordinary axis for the refractive index is orthogonal to the director .

## 3.6.3 melted-grain-boundary mesophase ( MGBC * )

Mesophase with a helicoidal supramolecular structure of blocks of molecules with a local smectic C structure . The layer normal to the blocks rotates on a cone to create a helix-like director in the smectic C * . The blocks are separated by plane boundaries perpendicular to the  helical  axis.  At  the  boundary,  the smectic order  disappears  but  the nematic order  is maintained. In the blocks the director rotates from one boundary to the other to allow the rotation of the blocks without any discontinuity in the thermomolecular orientation.

Note: This phase appears between the TGBA and SmC * or N * and SmC * mesophases .

## 4 TEXTURES AND DEFECTS

## 4.1 domain

Region of a mesophase having a single director .

Note: See 3.1.1.1 for the definition of a

## 4.2 monodomain

Region of a uniaxial mesophase or a whole uniaxial mesophase having a single director or a region of a biaxial mesophase or a whole biaxial mesophase having two directors .

Note 1:  See  3.1.1  for  the  definition  of  a uniaxial  nematic mesophase ,  5.8.1  for  the definition  of  uniaxial mesophase anisotropy,  and  Definitions  3.3  and  5.8.2  relating  to biaxial mesophases .

Note 2:  For a smectic mesophase , the term monodomain  also  implies a uniform arrangement of the smectic layers.

## 4.3 homeotropic alignment

Molecular alignment of which the director is perpendicular to a substrate surface.

Note 1:  See Fig. 20a.

Note 2:  When the alignment of the director in a homeotropic alignment deviates from the perpendicular, the alignment is said to be a pre-tilted homeotropic alignment ; the pre-tilt angle is the deviation from 90 o .

Note 3: Surface pretilt is the deviation angle of the director away from the surface. It is used to control the threshold voltage and affects viewing angles.

Note: See Fig. 20b.

## 4.5 uniform planar alignment

Molecular alignment in which the director is parallel to a substrate surface.

Note 1:  See Fig. 20c.

Note 2:  Sometimes  a  uniform  planar  alignment  is  called  a  'uniform  homogeneous alignment'. The latter term is not recommended.

director .

## TERMINOLOGY

Note 1:  See  Fig.  21.  The  length  of  a  line  in  Fig.  21  indicates  the  length  of  a director projected onto the plane of the page.

Note 2:  The  orientation  of  the directors on  the  upper  and  lower  substrate  surfaces  are usually mutually orthogonal and hence the directors undergo a 90 ° twist over the thickness of the liquid-crystal layer.

Fig. 21. Illustrating a twist alignment.

<!-- image -->

## 4.7 defect

Non-uniform molecular alignment that cannot be transformed into a uniform alignment without creating other defects.

Note 1:  Dislocations and disclinations are major types of defects in liquid crystals.

Note 2:  Three elementary types of defects may be distinguished in liquid crystals. They are point, line and wall defects,.

Note 3:  A  discontinuity  in  the  structure  (or  in  the  mathematical  function  describing  the structure)  is  considered  as  a  singularity;  in  many  cases  a  defect  can  be  regarded  as  a singularity.

## 4.7.1 dislocation

Discontinuity in a regular molecular positional arrangement.

Note: Dislocations are found mainly in solid crystals.

## 4.7.2 disclination

Defect along a line in the regular orientation of directors .

Note 1:  Disclinations  are  responsible  for  some optical  textures seen  with  a  polarizing microscope,  such  as  the schlieren  texture formed  by  disclination  lines  in  nearly  vertical orientations,  whose  projections  are  seen  as  dark  points  with  two  or  four  emerging  dark stripes or brushes (see Definition 4.9.2).

Note 2:  Disclinations are defects in molecular orientational order in contrast to dislocations that are defects in molecular positional order.

## 4.8 optical texture

Image of a liquid-crystal sample seen with a microscope, usually with crossed polarizers.

Note: An optical texture results from surface orientation of the directors at the boundaries of the sample and by defects formed in the sample.

## 4.9 nematic textures

## 4.9.1 nematic droplet

Spherical droplet that forms during a transition from an isotropic phase to a nematic mesophase . It has characteristic textures that depend on the droplet size and the director orientation at the nematic-isotropic interface.

Note: Nematic droplets display a texture characteristic of a nematic mesophase since they occur nowhere else.

## 4.9.1.1 bipolar droplet texture

Texture with two point defects at the poles of a nematic droplet .

Note 1:  A pole is the position of the extreme of a director in a droplet.

Note 2:  The point defects are called boojums.

Note 3:  A bipolar droplet texture occurs when the director lies in the plane of a nematicisotropic interface.

## 4.9.1.2 radial droplet texture

Texture with one point defect at the center of a nematic droplet .

Note 1:  The  point defect usually  forms  when  the director is  normal  to  the  nematicisotropic interface.

Note 2:  The radial droplet texture shows four dark brushes located in the regions where the director is in the polarization plane of either the polarizer or the analyser.

## 4.9.2 schlieren texture

Texture observed for a flat sample between crossed polarizers, showing a network of black brushes connecting centers of point and line defects.

Note 1:  The black brushes are also called black stripes or schlieren brushes.

Note 2:  Black  brushes  are  located  in  regions  where  the director lies  in  the  plane  of polarization of either the polarizer or the analyser.

Note 3:  Schlieren  textures  observed  in nematic samples  with planar  alignment show defect centers  with  two  or  four  emerging  brushes.  Schlieren textures in nematic samples with tilted alignments show centers with four brushes; centers with two brushes are caused by defect walls.

Note 4:  A thin sample of a smectic C phase with the layers parallel to the sample surfaces gives schlieren textures with centers that have four brushes. However, a smectic C phase formed  by  odd-membered  liquid-crystal  dimers  (see  Definition  2.11.2.9,  Note  5)  has schlieren textures with two or four brushes.

## 4.9.2.1 nucleus

Center of a point or line defect from which black brushes originate when a liquid crystal is observed between crossed polarizers.

Note: A nucleus can indicate either the end of a disclination line terminating at the surface of a sample or an isolated defect .

## 4.9.2.2 disclination strength , s

- 0, =0

Note 1: s is  positive  when  the  brushes  turn  in  the  same  direction  as  the  polarizer  and analyser  when  they  are  rotated  together,  and  negative  when  they  turn  in  the  opposite direction.

Note 2: s can be an integer or half-integer since in nematics the directors + n and -n are not distinguishable.

Note 3:  The  angular  distribution φ of  the director around  a defect in  a nematic planar texture , in the X-Y projection, can be expressed in terms of the polar angle θ r

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where θ r  represents  the  angular  polar  co-ordinate  of  a  given  point  with  respect  to  the disclination center, φ is the angle that the local director axis at that point makes with the θ r = 0 axis and φ o is a constant (0 &lt; φ o &lt; 2 π ) (See Fig. 22).

The product s θ r yields the angle by which the director turns on a closed curve around the disclination center.  If  a  complete  circuit  is  made  around  the  center  of  an s = ± ½ disclination ,  the director rotates  by π .  For s = ± 1 a similar circuit yields a total director rotation  of  2 π . So, s = ± ½  defines  a π -line  disclination and s = ± 1  defines  a 2 π -line disclination .

Note 4: Director alignments for point defects with different values of s are  illustrated in Fig. 23.

## 4.9.3 threaded texture

Texture  with π -line  disclinations  which  lie  essentially  parallel  to  the  surfaces  between which a sample is placed, with the ends of the lines attached to the surfaces and the other parts of the lines moving freely in the liquid crystal, appearing as thin thread-like lines.

## 4.9.3.1 surface disclination line adhering thread

Thick, thread-like disclination line anchored along its length to the upper or the lower of the surfaces between which a sample is placed.

## 4.9.4 marbled texture

Texture consisting of several areas with different director orientations.

Note:  On  observing  a  sample  with  a  marbled  texture  between  crossed  polarizers,  the interference  colour  is  essentially  uniform  within  each  individual  area,  indicating  an essentially homogeneous region.

## 4.10 smectic textures

## 4.10.1 bâtonnet

Droplet, usually non-spherical, of a smectic phase nucleating from an isotropic phase.

## 4.10.2 focal-conic domain

Domain formed  by  deformed smectic layers  that  fold  around  two  confocal  line  defects preserving equidistance of structural layers everywhere except in the vicinity of the defect lines.

Note 1:  See Fig. 24. The confocal line defects may be an ellipse and a hyperbola or two parabolae.

Note 2:  The smectic layers  within a focal-conic domain adopt the arrangement of Dupin cyclides,  since  as  in  these  figures  there  appear  concentric  circles  resulting  from  the intersection of  ellipses  and  hyperbolae.  They  also  have  the  distinctive  property  of preserving an equal distance between them.

Note 3:  A  focal-conic  domain  built  around  an  ellipse  and  an  hyperbola  is  the  most common type of defect in thermotropic smectic A phases. The hyperbola passes through a focus of the ellipse and the ellipse passes through the focus of the hyperbola (see Fig. 24).

Note 4:  In a particular limiting case of an ellipse-hyperbola focal-conic domain, the ellipse becomes a straight line passing through the center of a circle.

hyperbola central domain

Note 5:  A focal-conic domain built around two confocal parabolae is called a parabolic focal-conic domain .

Note 6:  At  any  point  inside  a  focal-conic  domain,  the director is  oriented  along  the straight line drawn through the point and the two defect lines (ellipse and hyperbola or two parabolae or circle and straight line). See for example BD, BC and BO in Fig. 24.

## 4.10.3 polygonal texture

Texture  composed  of focal-conic  domains of  the  ellipse-hyperbola  type  with  visible ellipses, or parts of ellipses, located at the boundary surfaces.

Note 1:  See Figs. 25a and 25b.

Note 2:  One  branch  of  the  hyperbola  (either  above  or  below  the  plane  of  the  ellipse)  is usually missing in the polygonal texture.

Note 3:  Neighbouring domains form a family with a common apex where the hyperbolae of  these domains join  each  other.  This  common  point  is  located  at  the  surface  that  is opposite to the surface containing the ellipses (see Fig. 26). Each family is bounded by a polygon formed by hyperbolic and elliptical axes; these are parts of focal-conic domains that provide a smooth variation of smectic layers between the domains of different families. These domains are the tetrahedra in Fig. 26.

Note 4:  The smectic layers pass continuously from one focal-conic to the next.

## 4.10.4 focal-conic, fan-shaped texture

Texture formed partly by focal-conic domains with their hyperbolae lying in the plane of observation.

Note 1:  See Fig. 27.

Note 2:  The layers are aligned almost normal to the sample surfaces. The regular sets of hyperbolae are called ' boundaries of Grandjean '; they serve as limiting surfaces between domains with different director orientations.

## 5 PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LIQUID CRYSTALS

General Note: In this section the director n is treated mathematically as a unit vector, with components n 1 , n 2, n 3 along space-fixed axes X1, X2, X3.

## 5.1 order parameter , 〉 〈 2 P

Parameter characterizing the long-range orientational order with reference to the director , with

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where β is the angle between the molecular symmetry axis and the director and 〈 〉 denotes an ensemble average.

Note 1: 〉 〈 2 P characterises long-range molecular order.

Note 2:  For rod-like molecules, the order parameter of the effective molecular symmetry axis  at  the  nematic-isotropic  transition  is  about  0.3  and  can  increase  to  about  0.7  in  the nematic mesophase .

## TERMINOLOGY

Note 3:  Molecules  which  constitute  nematogens  are  not  strictly  cylindrically  symmetric and have their orientational order given by the Saupe ordering matrix which has elements S αβ = (3&lt;| α | β &gt; -δαβ )/2, where 1 α and 1 β are the direction cosines between the director and the molecular axes α and β , δαβ is the Kronecker delta and α , β denote the molecular axes X, Y, Z.

Note 4:  The constituent molecules of a nematogen are rarely rigid and their orientational order is strictly defined, at the second-rank level, by a Saupe ordering matrix for each rigid sub-unit.

Note 5:  Even for molecules with cylindrical symmetry, &lt; P 2&gt; does not provide a complete description of the orientational order. Such a description requires the singlet orientational distribution  function  which  can  be  represented  as  an  expansion  in  a  basis  of  Legendre polynomials P L cos β , with L an even integer. The expansion coefficients are proportional to the order parameters &lt; P L &gt; of the same rank. It is these order parameters which provide a complete description of the long-range orientational order.

Note 2:  A  splay  deformation  is  described  by  the  non-zero  derivatives ( ) 1 1 3 x n n ∂ ∂ and ( ) 1 1 3 x n n ∂ ∂ , where the symbols are defined in Definition 5.2.

Deformation in the direction of the initial director , n , characterised by n × rot n ≠ 0.

Note 1:  See Fig. 29 and Definition 5.3.

Note 2:  The degree of bending is given by the component of rot n perpendicular to n .

Note 3:  A  bend  deformation  is  described  by  the  non-zero  derivatives ( ) 1 1 3 x n n ∂ ∂ and ( ) 1 1 3 x n n ∂ ∂ , where the symbols are defined in Definition 5.2.

Note 1:  See Fig. 30 and Definition 5.3.

Note 2:  The degree of twisting is given by the component of rot n parallel to n .

## 5.3 elastic constants , Ki where i = 1, 2 and 3, SI unit : Nm -2 elasticity moduli

Coefficients K 1 , K 2 and K 3, in the expression for the distortion-Gibbs energy density, g , of a bulk nematic liquid crystal ; with

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where g 0 is the Gibbs-energy density of the undistorted liquid crystal, n is the director , and K 1 , K 2, and K 3 are the elastic constants for splay, twist, and bend deformations, respectively.

Note 1:  In the equation for g , the term g 0 is usually equal to zero because the undistorted state of nematics is  the  state  of  uniform alignment. However, for chiral nematics ,  a  nonzero  value  of g 0 allows  for  the  intrinsic  twist  in  the  structure.  In  order  to  describe g for smectic phases, an additional term must be added, due to the partially solid-like character of the smectic state and arising from positional molecular deformations.

Note 2:  In low molar mass nematics composed of rod-like molecules, the bend constant K 3 is  the  largest  while  the  twist  constant K 2  is  the  smallest.  Typical  values  of K 1 are 10 -11 - 10 -12 N m -2 .

Note 3:  The names of Oseen, Zocher, and Frank are associated with the development of the theory for the elastic behaviour of nematics and  so  the  elastic  constants may also be described as the Oseen-Zocher-Frank constants ,  although  the term Frank constants is frequently used.

## 5.4 Leslie-Ericksen coefficients , α i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, SI unit: Pa s

Six viscosity coefficients required for a description of the dynamics of an incompressible, nematic liquid crystal .

Note 1:  Assuming Onsager's reciprocal relations for irreversible processes,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and the number of independent coefficients reduces to five.

Note 2:  For nematics formed  by  low-molar-mass compounds, the Leslie coefficients are typically in the range 10 -2 to 10 -1 Pa s.

## 5.5 Miesowicz coefficient , η i i = 1, 2 and 3, SI unit: Pa s

Ratio of the shear stress, σ ,  to  the  shear  velocity  gradient, γ , for a nematic liquid  crystal with a particular director orientation, denoted by i , under the action of an external field:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note 1:  The  three  Miesowicz  coefficients  ( η 1 , η 2,  and η 3 )  describe  the  shear  flow  of  a nematic phase  with  three  different director orientations,  (see  Fig.  31)  namely: η 1 for  the director parallel to the shear-flow axis; η 2 for the director parallel to the velocity gradient; and η 3 for the director perpendicular to the shear flow and to the velocity gradient.

Note 2:  Usually

## 5.6 friction coefficients , γi i = 1 and 2, SI unit: Pa s rotational viscosity coefficients

Coefficients that define the energy dissipation associated with a rotation of the director in an incompressible, nematic liquid crystal.

Note 1:  The  rotational  viscosity  coefficients  are  of  the  order  of  10 -2 -10 -1 Pa  s  for  lowmolar-mass liquid  crystals;  for polymeric  liquid-crystals their  values  depend  strongly  on the molar mass of the polymer.

Note 2:  The  friction coefficients  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the L eslie-Ericksen coefficients as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

## TERMINOLOGY

N ote 3: Ȗ 1 is often called the rotational viscosity or the twist viscosity, i.e., the viscosity associated with the rotation of the director without material flow.

## 5.7 backflow

Motion of a liquid crystal associated with the rate of change of the director in the direction o pp osite to that of the action of an external field.

## 5.8 anisotropy of physical properties

De p endence of certain p hysical p ro p erties,  like  the  electric p ermittivity,  refractive  index and magnetic susce p ti b ility on direction. It is created b y long-range orientational order in a meso p hase , p rovided the corres p onding molecular p ro p erty is anisotro p ic.

N ote: The symmetry of the tensor re p resenting the average anisotro p ic p ro p erty cannot b e lower than the symmetry of the p hase.

## 5.8.1 uniaxial mesophase anisotropy , χ ~ ∆

Value of a p ro p erty χ ~ p arallel to the director II χ ~ minus that p er p endicular to it ⊥ χ ~ :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

N ote 1:  The tilde is used to indicate a p ro p erty of a liquid-crystal meso p hase .

N ote 2: χ ~ ∆ p rovides  a p ractical  measure  of  the  orientational  order  of  a meso p hase and necessarily  vanishes in an isotro p ic p hase.

N ote 3:  For meso p hases com p osed of cylindrically symmetric molecules there is a p recise relationshi p b etween  the  magnetic  anisotro p y, χ ~ ∆ ,  and  the  second-rank  orientational p arameter ² ¢ 2 P .

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and the b iaxial meso p hase anisotro p y is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

N ote 1:  The long-range b iaxial ordering of the meso p hase means that the three p rinci p al com p onents of a second-rank tensorial p ro p erty will not normally b e the same, hence the two measures of the anisotro p y χ ~ ∆ and δχ ~ .

N ote 2:  At a transition to a unia x ial meso p hase δχ ~ vanishes. The relative biaxiality , Ș , is defined as the ratio of δχ ~ to χ ~ ∆ .

## 5.9 ferroelectric effects

Ferroelectric meso p hase that a pp ears through the b reaking of symmetry in a tilted smectic meso p hase b y the introduction of molecular chirality and, hence, meso p hase chirality.

N ote 1:  When  the  num b ers  of  layers  with  o pp osite  tilt  directions  are  not  the  same,  the smectic meso p hase has ferroelectric p ro p erties.

N ote 2:  The  a pp earance  of  a  s p ontaneous p olarization,  | P s |,  in chiral  tilted smectic meso p hases is caused b y a long-range ordering of molecular transverse electric di p oles.

N ote 3:  The p olarization | P s | can b e switched b etween two sta b le states with an external electric field ( E ); these states are sta b le in zero electric field.

N ote 4:  The switching time, τ , is given b y

N ote 6:  Ty p ical  values  of  the  s p ontaneous p olarization,  | P s |,  in chiral  smectic  C meso p hases are b etween 10 -3 and 10 -4 C m -2 .

N ote 7:  When  the  tilt  direction  alternates  from  layer  to  layer,  the smectic meso p hase is antiferroelectric; such meso p hases do  not p ossess s p ontaneous p olarization. They can b e turned into ferroelectric structures through the a pp lication of an electric field.

## 5.10 Fréedericksz transition

Elastic deformation of the director , induced b y a magnetic induction or electric field, in a uniformly aligned, thin sam p le of a nematic confined b etween two surfaces.

N ote 1:  The Fréedericksz transition occurs when the strength of the a pp lied field exceeds a certain threshold value (see Definition 5.12).

N ote 2:  For the magnitude of the magnetic induction this threshold has the form

## 5.11 electroclinic effect

## 5.12 threshold fields

threshold electric field , E th, SI unit: V m -1

threshold magnetic induction , B th, SI unit: T

Critical  electric  field  strength  or  magnetic  induction  necessary  to  change  the  equilibrium director alignment imposed by constraining surfaces.

Note: See Definition 5.10, Notes 1-3.

## 5.13 electrohydrodynamic instabilities , ( EHD instabilities )

Instabilities  caused  by  the  anisotropy  of  conductivity  and  corresponding  to  a  periodic deformation of the alignment of the director in a nematic monodomain under the action of a direct current or low-frequency alternating current.

Note 1:  See Definition 4.2 for the definition of a monodomain .

Note 2:  The  basic  electric  parameters  determining  EHD  instabilities  are  the  dielectric anisotropy, ε ~ ∆ , and the anisotropy of the (ionic) conductivity, σ ~ ∆ .

Distortion of the director ,  space charges and the motion of the fluid are coupled through the  applied  electric  field.  Above  a  given  threshold,  fluctuations  of  these  quantities  are amplified and EHD instabilities develop.

## 5.14 Williams domains

## Kapustin domains

Regions in a liquid crystal having a specific cellular periodic flow-pattern in the form of long rolls induced by the application of an electric field perpendicular to a nematic layer with an initial planar alignment of the director .

Note 1:  The nematic liquid  crystal  must have a negative dielectric anisotropy ( ε ~ ∆ &lt;  0), and a positive anisotropy ( σ ~ ∆ &gt; 0). The optical texture corresponding to the flow pattern consists  of  a  set  of  regularly  spaced,  black  and  white  stripes  perpendicular  to  the  initial direction of the director .  These stripes are caused by the periodicity of the change in the refractive index for the extraordinary ray due to variations in the director orientation.

Note 2:  The domains exist over only a small range of electric-field strength.

## 5.15 dynamic-scattering mode, ( DSM )

State  of  a  liquid  crystal  that  shows  a  strong  scattering  of  light  due  to  a  turbulent  flow resulting from an applied voltage greater than a particular critical value.

Note 1:  In  DSM  the Williams ( Kapustin ) domains become  distorted  and  mobile,  and macroscopic director alignment is completely disturbed.

Note 2:  A liquid crystal in DSM has a complicated optical texture .

## 5.16 flexo-electric effect

Electric  polarization  resulting  from  a  splay  or  bend  deformation  of  the director of  a nematic liquid crystal.

Note 1:  See Fig. 32.

Note 2:  The molecular origins of dipolar flexo-electricity are the particular shape anisotropy (e.g., resembling a pear or banana) of the molecules, each of which must also possess a permanent dipole moment.

Note 3:  The net polarization, P , is proportional to the distortion:

Polar axi where e 1  and e 3  are  the  flexo-electric  coefficients.  They  have  the  units  of  an  electric p otential, namely J C -1 , of ar b itrary sign.

N ote 4:  The  flexo-electric  effect  is  the  analogue  of  the p iezo-electric  effect  in  solids, where the p olarization is induced b y a strain that p roduces a translational deformation of the crystal. The flexo-electric effect in a liquid crystal is caused b y a p urely orientational deformation.

N ote:  A  flexo-electric  domain  occurs  when ε ~ ∆ &lt;  4 ʌ el /K where e is  the  flexo-electric coefficient  and K is  the elastic  constant ,  assuming K 1 = K 3 = K and e 1 =  -e 3 =  e (see Definitions 5.3 and 5.16).

## 5.18 twisted-nematic cell

Twisted nematic liquid  crystal  sandwiched b etween  two  glass p lates,  with  the director aligned p arallel to the p lates, with one of the p lates turned in its own p lane a b out an axis normal to it.

## 5.19 'time-on' of the electro-optical effect , τ on , SI unit: s turn-on time

Time required for the light intensity viewed through crossed p olarizers to increase to 90% of  the  final  value  from  the  off-state  to  the  on-state  of  an  electro-o p tical  twisted-nematic cell.

N ote: In the off-state the electro-o p tical cell contains a thin film of a nematic liquid-cr y stal with mutually p er p endicular directors at the u pp er and lower glass p lates; hence to reach the on-state the director p erforms a 90 ° twist over the thickness of the liquid crystal film.

## TERMINOLOGY

## 5.20 'time-off' of the electro-optical effect , τ off , SI unit: s turn-off time

The time required for the light intensity viewed through crossed p olarizers to decrease b y 90% from the on-state to the off-state of an electro-o p tical twisted-nematic cell.

## 5.22 fall time , SI unit: s decay time

N

ote: See the note to Definition 5.19.

## 5.23 guest-host effect

Field-induced  change  in  the  orientation  of  either  dichroic  dye  molecules  (the  guest) dissolved in a meso p hase (the host) or dichroic dye moieties (the guest) of p olymers (the host) resulting in changes in the a b sor p tion s p ectrum of a mesomor p hic mixture.

Note 3:  Examples of polymer backbones are polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, and polysiloxanes; the spacers are usually oligomethylene, oligo(oxyethylene), or oligosiloxane.

Note 4:  The  pendant  groups  in  these  polymers  have  structures  compatible  with  liquidcrystal  formation,  that  is,  they  are mesogen ic  but  not  intrinsically  mesomorphic.  See  the examples given in Definitions 2.10; 2.11.2.1.

Note 5:  If  the mesogen ic  side-groups  are  rod-like  ( calamitic )  in  nature,  the  resulting polymer may, depending upon its detailed structure, exhibit any of the common types of calamitic mesophases : nematic , chiral nematic or smectic . Side-on fixed SGPLC, however, are  predominantly nematic or chiral  nematic in  character.  Similarly,  disc-shaped  sidegroups tend to promote discotic nematic or columnar mesophases while amphiphilic sidechains tend to promote amphiphilic or lyotropic mesophases .

Note 6:  A plethora of types of copolymers can be produced. For example, nonmesogen ic side-groups may be used in conjunction with mesogen ic side-groups and the polymer backbone may be substituted, to various degrees, with side-groups or chains.

## 6.4 spacer

Flexible segment used to link successive mesogen ic units in the molecules of MCPLCs or to attach mesogen ic units as side-groups onto the polymer backbone of SGPLCs.

Note 1:  Examples  of spacers are:  oligomethylene,  oligooxyethylene,  or  oligosiloxane chains.

Note 2:  The term is also used for the group linking two or more mesogen ic units in liquidcrystal oligomers .

## 6.5 disruptor

Chemical group used to disrupt the linearity of the backbone of molecules of MCLCPs. Note: Examples are (a, b) rigid-kink or (c) crankshaft units.

## 6.6 combined liquid-crystalline polymer

L iquid-crystalline  polymer consisting  of  macromolecules in which mesogenic groups are incorporated both in the main-chain and in the side-groups.

Note: See Fig. 35. The mesogen ic side-groups can be attached either as lateral substituents to the backbone mesogen ic moieties that are connected to each other either (a) directly or (b) by spacers or (c) they can be attached to the spacer incorporated into the main-chain.

## 6.7 rigid chain

Rod-like chain of a MCPLC with direct links between the mesogenic groups for which the persistence length is at least comparable with the contour length and much greater than the diameter.

Note 1:  The persistence length is a characteristic of the stiffness of a chain in the limit of infinite chain length.

Note 2:  A  polymer  composed  of  molecules  that  have  rigid  rod-like  groups  or  chains usually does not show thermotropic mesomorphic behaviour because decomposition occurs below its melting point.

Note 3:  A polymer composed of molecules that have rigid rod-like groups or chains may form L C mesophases in solution under suitable conditions. These are sometimes described as lyotropic but, as the solvent does not induce the formation of aggregates or micelles, this term is not appropriate.

## 6.8 semi-rigid chain

Chain for which the contour length is greater than the persistence length but for which their ratio is still below the Gaussian limit.

Note: Some polymers composed of semi-rigid chains form amphiphilic mesogens .

Examples: polyisocyanates and (2-hydroxyethyl)cellulose.

## 6.9 board-shaped polymer

Polymer  chain  composed  of  a  rigid  backbone  to  which  many  lateral  side-groups  are attached, giving the repeating unit a board-like shape.

Note 1:  The rigid backbone often has a polyester, polyamide or poly(ester-amide) type of structure. Examples are:

Note 2:  A polymer L C consisting of macromolecules of board-like shape can be called a board-shaped polymer L C . Such polymers can form sanidic mesophases .

## 6.10 liquid-crystal dendrimer dendrimeric liquid crystal dendritic liquid crystal

Highly branched oligomer or polymer of dendritic structure containing mesogenic groups that can display mesophase behaviour.

Note 1:  See  Fig.  36.  The mesogenic  groups can  be  located  along  the  chains  of  the molecule (a) or can occur as terminal groups (b).

mesogenic group

Note 2:  The mesogenic  groups can  be,  e.g.,  rod-like  or  disc-like,  and  can  be  attached laterally or longitudinally to the flexible spacers .

## 6.11 hyperbranched polymer liquid-crystal

Polymer  composed  of  highly  branched  macromolecules  containing mesogenic  groups of which  any  linear  subchain  generally  may  lead  in  either  direction,  to  at  least  two  other subchains.

## 6.12 banded texture band texture

Alternating dark and bright bands observed, following shear, in a wide range of main-chain nematic and chiral nematic liquid-crystalline polymers .

Note 1:  The bands always lie perpendicular to the prior shear direction.

Note 2:  In general, bands form after the cessation of shear, but, under some circumstances, they may appear during the flow process

Note 3:  The bands are associated with a periodic variation in the director orientation about the flow axis.
