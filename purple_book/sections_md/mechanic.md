## PREAMBLE

This document gives definitions of terms related to the non-ultimate mechanical behaviour or  mechanical  behaviour  prior  to  failure  of  polymeric  materials,  in  particular  of  bulk polymers and concentrated solutions and their elastic and viscoelastic properties.

The terms are arranged into sections dealing with basic definitions of stress and strain, deformations  used  experimentally, stresses observed  experimentally,  quantities  relating stress  and  deformation,  linear  viscoelastic  behaviour,  and  oscillatory  deformations  and stresses used experimentally for solids. The terms which have been selected are those met in the conventional mechanical characterization of polymeric materials.

To  compile  the  definitions,  a  number  of  sources  have  been  used.  A  number  of  the definitions  were  adapted  from  an  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO) manuscript  on  Plastics  Vocabulary  [1].  Where  possible,  the  names  for  properties,  their definitions  and  the  symbols  for  linear  viscoelastic  properties  were  checked  against  past compilations of terminology [2-6]. Other documents consulted include ASTM publications [7-13].

The  document  does  not  deal  with  the  properties  of  anisotropic  materials.  This  is  an extensive subject in its own right and the reader is referred to specialized texts [14,15] for information.

In  the  list  of  contents,  main  terms  separated  by  /  are  alternative  names,  and  terms  in parentheses give those which are defined in the context of main terms, usually as notes to the  definitions  of  main  terms,  with  their  names  printed  in  bold  type  in  the  main  text. Multicomponent  quantities  (vectors,  tensors,  matrices)  are  printed  in  bold  type.  Names

printed in italics are defined elsewhere in the document and their definitions can be found by reference to the alphabetical list of terms.

## NOTE on tensor terminology and symbols ∗

The tensor quantities given in this chapter are all second rank, and are sometimes referred to as matrices , according to common usage, so that the two terms, tensor and matrix, are used interchangeably. In many cases, the components (or coefficients) of second-rank tensors are represented by 3 × 3 matrices. Symbols for tensors (matrices) are printed in bold italic type, while symbols for the components are printed in italic type. In general, the base tensors are those for a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system.

## 1 BASIC DEFINITIONS

In this section, quantities are expressed with respect to rectangular Cartesian co-ordinate axes, Ox 1 , Ox 2 , Ox 3,  except  where  otherwise  stated.  The  components  of  a  vector V are denoted V 1 , V 2 and V 3 with respect to these axes.

## 1.1 traction , t , SI unit: Pa stress vector

Vector force per unit area on an infinitesimal element of area that has a given normal and is at a given point in a body.

Note 1:  The components of t are written as t 1 , t 2 , t 3 .

Note 2: t is sometimes called true stress. The term traction (or stress vector) is preferred to avoid confusion with stress tensor .

## 1.2 stress tensor , σ , SI unit: Pa stress

Tensor with components σ ij which are the components of the traction in the Oxi direction on an element of area whose normal is in the Oxj direction.

Note 1:  A unit vector area with normal n can be resolved into three smaller areas equal to n 1 , n 2 and n 3 with normals in the directions of the respective co-ordinate axes. Accordingly, each  component  of  the traction on  the  original  area  can  be  considered  as  the  sum  of components in the same direction on the smaller areas to give

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note 2:  In usual circumstances, in the absence of body couples, σ ij = σ ji .

Note 3:  For a homogeneous stress σ is the same at all points in a body.

Note 4:  For an inhomogeneous stress σ ij = σ ij ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ).

Note 5: σ is  a true  stress because  its  components  are  forces  per  unit  current  area  (c.f. Notes 3 and 4).

Note 6:  If σ 13 ( = σ 31 ) = σ 23 ( = σ 32 ) = σ 33 = 0 then the stress is called a plane stress . Plane stresses are associated with the deformation of a sheet of material in the plane of the sheet.

## 5 LINEAR VISCOELASTIC BEHAVIOUR

## 5.1 viscoelasticity

Time-dependent response of a liquid or solid subjected to stress or strain.

Note 1:  Both  viscous  and  elastic  responses  to stress or  strain  are  required  for  the description of viscoelastic behaviour.

Note 2:  Viscoelastic  properties  are  usually  measured  as  responses  to  an  instantaneously applied or removed constant stress or  strain  or  a dynamic stress or strain .  The latter is defined as a sinusoidal stress or strain of small amplitude, which may or may not decrease with time.

## 5.2 linear viscoelastic behaviour

Interpretation of the viscoelastic behaviour of a liquid or solid in simple shear or uniaxial deformation such that

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where σ is  the  shear  stress  or  uniaxial stress, γ is  the  shear  strain  or uniaxial strain ,  and P (D) and Q (D) are polynomials in D, where D is the differential coefficient operator d / d t .

Note 1:  In linear viscoelastic behaviour , stress and strain are assumed to be small so that the squares and higher powers of σ and γ may be neglected.

Note 2:  See Definitions 3.5 and 2.13 for the definitions of σ and γ in simple shear .

Note 3:  See  Definitions  3.2  and  2.12  for  definitions  of σ and γ ( ≡ γ E )  in uniaxial deformations .

Note 4:  The polynomials Q (D) and P

(D) have the forms:

Q (D) = a (D + q 0 ) . . . . . (D + qn ) (a polynomial of degree n + 1) P (D) = (D + p 0 )(D + p 1 ) . . (D + pn ) (a polynomial of degree n + 1) P (D) = (D + p 0 ) (D + p 1 ) . . (D + pn1 ) (a polynomial of degree n )

where

- (iii) qi &lt; pi &lt; qi+ 1 and qn &lt; pn (if pn exists) with pi and qi related to relaxation and retardation times , respectively.

Note 5:  If q 0= 0, the material is a liquid, otherwise it is a solid.

Note 6:  Given that Q (D) is a polynomial of degree n + 1; if P (D) is also of degree n + 1 the material shows instantaneous elasticity; if P (D) is of degree n ,  the  material  does  not show instantaneous elasticity (i.e. elasticity immediately the deformation is applied.) Note 7:  There are definitions of linear viscoelasticity which use integral equations instead of  the  differential  equation  in  Definition  5.2.  (See,  for  example,  [11].)  Such  definitions have certain advantages regarding their mathematical generality. However, the approach in the  present  document,  in  terms  of  differential  equations,  has  the  advantage  that  the definitions  and  descriptions  of  various  viscoelastic  properties  can  be  made  in  terms  of commonly  used  mechano-mathematical  models  (e.g.  the Maxwell and Voigt-Kelvin models ).

## 5.3 Maxwell model Maxwell element

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where α and β are positive constants, D the differential coefficient operator d / d t , and σ and γ are the stress and strain in simple shear or uniaxial deformation .

Note 1:  See Definition 5.2 for a discussion of σ and γ .

Note 2:  The relationship defining the Maxwell model may be written

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note 3:  Comparison  with  the  general  definition  of linear  viscoelastic  behaviour shows that the polynomials P (D) and Q (D) are of order one, q 0 = 0, p 0 = β / α and a = 1/ α . Hence, a

material described by a Maxwell model is a liquid ( q 0 = 0) having instantaneous elasticity ( P (D) and Q (D) are of the same order).

Note 4:  The Maxwell model may be represented by a spring and a dashpot filled with a Newtonian  liquid in series, in which case 1/ α is the spring  constant (force = 1/ α )·extension) and 1/ β is the dashpot constant (force = (1/ β )·rate of extension).

Note 1:  The Voigt-Kelvin model is also known as the Voigt model or Voigt element .

Note 2:  See Definition 5.2 for a discussion of σ and γ .

Note 3:  The relationship defining the Voigt-Kelvin model may be written

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note 4:  Comparison  with  the  general  definition of  linear  viscoelastic  behaviour shows that the polynomial P (D) is of order zero, Q (D) is of order one, aq 0 = α and a = β . Hence, a material  described  by  the  Voigt-Kelvin  model  is  a solid ( q 0 &gt;  0)  without  instantaneous elasticity ( P (D) is a polynomial of order one less than Q (D)).

Note 5:  The Voigt-Kelvin model may be represented by a spring and a dashpot filled with a  Newtonian  liquid  in  parallel,  in  which  case α is the spring  constant (force  = α ·extension) and β is the dashpot constant (force = β ·rate of extension).

Note 2:  The relationship defining the standard linear viscoelastic solid may be written

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note 3:  Comparison with the general definition of a linear viscoelastic behaviour shows that the polynomial P (D) and Q (D) are of order one, q 0 = α 2 / β 2 , a = β 2 / β 1 and p 0 = α 1 / α 2 . Hence,  the  standard  linear  viscoelastic  solid  is  a  solid  ( aq 0 &gt; 0)  having  instantaneous elasticity ( P (D) and Q (D) are of the same order).

Note 4:  The standard linear viscoelastic solid may be represented by:

(i) a Maxwell model (of spring constant h 2 and dashpot constant k 2) in parallel with a spring (of spring constant h 1) in which case α 1 = h 2 , β 1 = k 2 , α 2 = h 1 h 2 and β 2 = h 1 k 2 + h 2 k 2 .

Note 5:  The  standard  linear  viscoelastic  solid  can  be  used  to  represent  both creep and stress  relaxation in materials  in terms  of  single retardation and relaxation  times , respectively.

## 5.6 relaxation time , τ , SI unit: s

Note 1:  The response of a material to the instantaneous application of a constant strain is termed stress relaxation .

Note 2:  The relaxation time of a Maxwell element is τ = 1 /p 0 = α / β .

Note 3:  The relaxation time of a standard linear viscoelastic solid is τ = 1 /p 0 = β 1 / α 1 .

Note 4:  Generally, a linear viscoelastic material has a spectrum of relaxation times, which are the reciprocals of pi , i = 0, 1, …, n in the polynomial P (D) (see Definition 5.2).

Note 5:  The relaxation  spectrum ( spectrum  of  relaxation  times )  describing stress relaxation in polymers may be considered as arising from a group of Maxwell elements in parallel.

## 5.7 stress relaxation

Note 2:  For linear viscoelastic behaviour , the strain usually takes the form

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

a is  a  constant  that  is  non-zero  if  the  material  has  instantaneous  elasticity  and b is  a constant that is non-zero if the material is a liquid. ψ ( t ) is the creep function . In addition,

## 6 OSCILLATORY DEFORMATIONS AND STRESSES USED EXPERIMENTALLY

There are three modes of free and forced oscillatory deformations which are commonly used experimentally, torsional oscillations , uniaxial extensional oscillations and flexural oscillations.

The oscillatory deformations and stresses can be used for solids and liquids. However, the  apparatuses  employed  to  measure  them  are  usually  designed  for  solid  materials.  In principle, they can be modified for use with liquids.

Analyses of the results obtained depend on the shape of the specimen, whether or not the distribution of mass in the specimen is accounted for and the assumed model used to represent  the  linear  viscoelastic  properties  of  the  material.  The  following  terms  relate  to analyses which generally assume small deformations, specimens of uniform cross-section, non-distributed mass and a Voigt-Kelvin solid.  These are the conventional assumptions.

## 6.1 free oscillation

Oscillatory  deformation  of  a  material  specimen  with  the  motion  generated  without  the continuous application of an external force.

Note:  For  any  real  sample  of  material  the  resulting  oscillatory  deformation  is  one  of decaying amplitude.

## 6.2 damping curve

Note 2:  The term 'damping curve' is sometimes used to describe a loss curve .

Note 3:  A  damping  curve  is  usually  obtained  using  a torsion  pendulum ,  involving  the measurement  of  decrease  in  the  axial,  torsional  displacement  of  a  specimen  of  uniform cross-section of known shape, with the torsional displacement initiated using a torsion bar of known moment of inertia.

Note 4:  Damping  curves  are  conventionally  analysed  in  terms  of  the Voigt-Kelvin solid giving a decaying amplitude and a single frequency.

## 6.6 forced uniaxial extensional oscillations

Uniaxial extensional deformation of a material specimen of uniform cross-sectional area along  its  long  axis  by  the  continuous  application  of  a  sinusoidal  force  of  constant amplitude.

Note 1:  For  a  specimen  of  negligible  mass,  the  linear-viscoelastic  interpretation  of  the resulting deformation gives

where P (D)  and Q (D)  are  the  polynomials  in  D  (=d/d t )  characterizing  the linearviscoelastic behaviour , A is the cross-sectional area of the specimen, L its original length, l is here the change in length, f 0 the amplitude of the applied force of angular velocity ω and t the time.

Note 2:  For  a Voigt-Kelvin solid,  with P (D)=1  and Q (D)= α + β D,  where α is  the  spring constant and β the dashpot constant, the equation describing the deformation becomes

Note 7:  Notes  2  and  5  show  that  application  of  a  sinusoidal  uniaxial  force  to  a VoigtKelvin solid  of  negligible  mass,  with  or  without  added  mass,  results  in  an  out-of-phase sinusoidal uniaxial extensional oscillation of the same frequency.

## 6.7 forced flexural oscillation

Flexural  deformation  (bending)  of  a  material  specimen  of  uniform  cross-sectional  area perpendicular  to  its  long  axis  by  the  continuous  application  of  a  sinusoidal  force  of constant amplitude.

Note 1:  There are three modes of flexure in common use.

- (i)  Application  of  the  flexural  force  at  one  end  of  the  specimen  with  the  other  end clamped.
- (ii)  Application of the flexural force at the centre of the specimen with the two ends clamped ( three-point bending or flexure ).
- (iii) Application of the flexural force at the centre of the specimen with the two ends resting freely on supports (also known as three-point bending or flexure ).

## NON-ULTIMATE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES

Note 2:  For specimens without mass , the linear-viscoelastic interpretation of the resulting deformations  follows  a  differential  equation  of  the  same  form  as  that  for a  uniaxial extensional forced oscillation , namely

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where P (D), Q (D), f 0 , ω and t have the same meaning as for a forced uniaxial extensional oscillation and H is a constant. The length of the specimen is 2 L . For mode of flexure (i) H =3, for (ii) H =24 and for (iii) H =6. J is the second moment of area of the specimen, defined by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where d A is an element of the cross-sectional area ( A ) of the specimen and q is the distance of  that  element  from  the neutral  axis  or  plane of  the  specimen,  lying  centrally  in  the specimen  and  defined  by  points  which  experience  neither  compression  nor  extension during the flexure. For a specimen of circular cross-section J = π r 2 /4, where r is the radius, and  for  one  of  rectangular  cross-section J =4 ab 3 /3,  where  2 a and  2 b are  the  lateral dimensions with flexure along the b dimension. Finally, y is the flexural deflection of the specimen at the point of application of the force, of either the end (mode of flexure (i)) or the middle (modes of flexure (ii) and (iii)).

Note 3:  For a Voigt-Kelvin solid, the equation describing the deformation becomes

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

with solution

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where δ is the phase angle with

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

equal to the loss tangent .

Note 4:  Unlike  the  strain  in forced  uniaxial  extensional  oscillations ,  those  in forced flexural deformations are not homogeneous. In the latter modes of deformation, the strains vary from point-to-point in the specimen. Hence, the equation defining the displacement y in terms of the amplitude of applied force ( f 0 ) cannot be converted into one defining strain in terms of amplitude of stress .

Note 5:  If a mass m is attached to the specimen at the point of application of the force, the linear-viscoelastic interpretation of the resulting deformation gives
