## INTRODUCTION

It  is  the  intent  of  this  document  to  define  the  terms  most  commonly  encountered  in  the field of polymer blends and composites. The scope has been limited to mixtures in which the  components differ in chemical  composition or molar mass or both and in which the continuous phase is polymeric. Many of the materials described by the term 'multiphase' are  two-phase  systems  that  may  show  a  multitude  of  finely  dispersed  phase  domains. Hence,  incidental  thermodynamic  descriptions  are  mainly  limited  to  binary  mixtures, although they can be and, in the scientific literature, have been generalized to multicomponent  mixtures.  Crystalline  polymers  and  liquid-crystal  polymers  have  been considered in other documents [1,2] and are not discussed here.

This  document  is  organized  into  three  sections.  The  first  defines  terms  basic  to  the description  of  polymer  mixtures.  The  second  defines  terms  commonly  encountered  in descriptions  of  phase-domain  behaviour  of  polymer  mixtures.  The  third  defines  terms commonly encountered in the descriptions of the morphologies of phase-separated polymer mixtures.

General terms describing the composition of a system as defined in ref. [3] are used without  further  definition  throughout  the  document.  Implicit  definitions  are  identified  in boldface type throughout the document.

## 1 BASIC TERMS IN POLYMER MIXTURES

## 1.1 polymer blend

Macroscopically homogeneous mixture of two or more different species of polymer [3,4]. Note 1: See the Gold Book, p. 312 [3].

Originally prepared by a working group consisting of W. J. Work (USA), K. Horie (Japan), M. Hess (Germany) and R. F. T. Stepto (UK). Reprinted from Pure Appl. Chem. , 76, 1985-2007 (2004)

## BLENDS, COMPOSITES, AND MULTIPHASE MATERIALS

Note 2: In  most  cases,  blends  are  homogeneous  on  scales  larger  than  several  times  the wavelengths of visible light.

Note 3: In principle, the constituents of a blend are separable by physical means.

Note 4: No  account  is  taken  of  the miscibility or  immiscibility  of  the  constituent macromolecules,  i.e.,  no  assumption  is  made  regarding  the  number  of phase  domains present.

Note 5: The use of the term ' polymer alloy '  for  'polymer  blend'  is  discouraged,  as  the former  term  includes multiphase  copolymers but  excludes  incompatible  polymer  blends (see Definition 1.3).

Note 6: The  number  of  polymeric  components  which  comprises  a  blend  is  often designated by an adjective, viz., binary, ternary, quaternary.

## 1.2 miscibility

Capability of a mixture to form a single phase over certain ranges of temperature, pressure, and composition.

Note 1: Whether or not a single phase exists depends on the chemical structure, molarmass distribution, and molecular architecture of the components present.

Note 2: The  single  phase  in  a  mixture  may  be  confirmed  by  light  scattering,  X-ray scattering, and neutron scattering.

Note 3: For a two-component mixture, a necessary and sufficient condition for stable or metastable equilibrium of a homogeneous single phase is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ∆ mix G is the Gibbs energy of mixing and φ the composition, where φ /uniF020 is usually taken as  the  volume  fraction  of  one  of  the  components.  The  system  is  unstable  if  the  above second derivative is negative. The borderline ( spinodal ) between (meta)stable and unstable states is defined by the above second derivative equalling zero. If the compositions of two conjugate (coexisting) phases become identical upon a change of temperature or pressure, the third derivative also equals zero (defining a critical state).

Note 4: If a mixture is thermodynamically metastable, it will demix if suitably nucleated (see Definition 2.5). If a mixture is thermodynamically unstable, it will demix by spinodal decomposition or by nucleation and growth if suitably nucleated, provided there is minimal kinetic hindrance.

## 1.3 miscible polymer blend

## homogeneous polymer blend

Polymer blend that exhibits miscibility .

Note 1: For a polymer blend to be miscible, it must satisfy the criteria of miscibility .

Note 2: Miscibility is sometimes erroneously assigned on the basis that a blend exhibits a single T g or optical clarity.

Note 3: A miscible system can be thermodynamically stable or metastable (see Note 4 in Definition 1.2).

Note 4: For  components  of  chain  structures  that  would  be  expected  to  be  miscible, miscibility may not occur if molecular architecture is changed, e.g., by crosslinking.

## 1.4 homologous polymer blend

Mixture  of  two  or  more  fractions  of  the  same  polymer,  each  of  which  has  a  different molar-mass distribution.

## 1.5 isomorphic polymer blend

Polymer blend of two or more different semi-crystalline polymers that are miscible in the crystalline state as well as in the molten state.

Note 1: Such a blend exhibits a single, composition-dependent glass-transition temperature, T g, and a single, composition-dependent melting point, T m, subscript

Note 2: This behaviour is extremely rare; very few cases are known.

## 1.6 polymer-polymer complex

Complex, at least two components of which are different polymers [4].

Note 1: A complex is a molecular entity formed from two or more components that can be ionic or uncharged [3].

Note 2: Although  the  intrinsic  binding  energy  between  the  individual  interacting  sites giving rise to the complex is weaker than a covalent bond, the total binding energy for any single molecule may exceed the energy of a single covalent bond.

Note 3: The  properties  of  a  complex  defined  here  differ  from  those  given  in  ref.  [3] because, owing to the repeating nature of a polymer molecule, many interacting sites may be present, which together will provide stronger bonding than a single covalent bond.

## 1.7 metastable miscibility

Capability of a mixture to exist for an indefinite period of time as a single phase that is separated  by  a  small  or  zero  energy  barrier  from  a  thermodynamically  more  stable multiphase system [3].

Note:  Mixtures  exhibiting  metastable  miscibility  may  remain  unchanged  or  they  may undergo phase separation, usually by nucleation or spinodal decomposition .

## 1.8 metastable miscible polymer blend

Polymer blend that exhibits metastable miscibility .

Note: In polymers, because of the low mobility of polymer chains, particularly in a glassy state, metastable mixtures  may  exist  for indefinite periods of  time  without  phase separation. This has frequently led to confusion when metastable miscible polymer blends are erroneously claimed to be miscible.

## 1.9 interpenetrating polymer network , ( IPN )

Polymer comprising two or more polymer networks which are at least partially interlaced on  a  molecular  scale,  but  not  covalently  bonded  to  each  other  and  cannot  be  separated unless chemical bonds are broken [3,4].

Note 1: A mixture of two or more preformed polymer networks is not an interpenetrating polymer network.

Note 2: An IPN may be further described by the process by which it is synthesized. When an  IPN  is  prepared  by  a  process  in  which  the  second  component  network  is  formed following  the  completion  of  formation  of  the  first  component  network,  the  IPN  may  be referred  to  as  a sequential  IPN .  When  an  IPN  is  prepared  by  a  process  in  which  both component  networks  are formed concurrently, the IPN  may  be  referred to as a simultaneous IPN.

## 1.10 semi-interpenetrating polymer network , ( SIPN )

Polymer comprising one or more polymer network(s) and one or more linear or branched polymer(s)  characterized  by  the  penetration  on  a  molecular  scale  of  at  least  one  of  the networks by at least some of the linear or branched chains [3,4].

Note 1: Semi-interpenetrating  polymer  networks  are different  from interpenetrating polymer networks because the constituent linear-chain or branched-chain macromolecule(s) can, in principle, be separated from the constituent polymer network(s) without breaking chemical bonds, and, hence, they are polymer blends .

Note 2: Semi-interpenetrating polymer networks may be further described by the process by  which  they  are  synthesized.  When  an  SIPN  is  prepared  by  a  process  in  which  the second  component  polymer  is  formed  or  incorporated  following  the  completion  of formation of the first  component polymer, the SIPN may be referred to  as a sequential

SIPN .  When  an  SIPN  is  prepared  by  a  process  in  which  both  component  polymers  are formed concurrently, the SIPN may be referred to as a simultaneous SIPN . (This note has been changed from that which appears in ref. [4] to allow for the possibility that a linear or branched polymer may be incorporated into a network by means other than polymerization, e.g., by swelling of the network and subsequent diffusion of the linear or branched chain into the network.).

## 1.11 immiscibility

Inability of a mixture to form a single phase.

Note 1: Immiscibility  may  be  limited  to  certain  ranges  of  temperature,  pressure,  and composition.

Note 2: Immiscibility depends on the chemical structures, molar-mass distributions, and molecular architectures of the components.

## 1.12

## immiscible polymer blend heterogeneous polymer blend

Polymer blend that exhibits immiscibility .

## 1.13 composite

Multicomponent material comprising multiple, different (non-gaseous) phase domains in which at least one type of phase domain is a continuous phase .

## 1.14 polymer composite

Composite in which at least one component is a polymer.

## 1.15 nanocomposite

Composite in  which at least one of the phases has at least one dimension of the order of nanometers.

## 1.16 laminate

Material  consisting  of  more  than  one  layer,  the  layers  being  distinct  in  composition, composition profile, or anisotropy of properties.

Note 1: Laminates may be formed by two or more layers of different polymers.

Note 2: Composite laminates generally consist of one or more layers of a substrate, often fibrous, impregnated with a curable polymer, curable polymers, or liquid reactants.

## TERMINOLOGY

Note 3: The  substrate  is  usually  a  sheet-like  woven  or  non-woven  material  (e.g.,  glass fabric, paper, copper foil).

Note 4: A single layer of a laminate is termed a lamina.

## 1.17 lamination

Process of forming a laminate .

## 1.18 delamination

Process that separates the layers of a laminate by breaking their structure in planes parallel to those layers.

## 1.19 impregnation

Penetration of monomeric, oligomeric, or polymeric liquids into an assembly of fibers.

Note 1: The term as defined here is specific to polymer science. An alternative definition of 'impregnation' applies in some other fields of chemistry [3].

## 1.20 prepreg

Sheets  of  a  substrate  that  have  been  impregnated  with  a  curable  polymer,  curable polymers, or liquid reactants, or a thermoplastic, and are ready for fabrication of laminates .

Note 2: During  the impregnation the  curable  polymer,  curable  polymers,  or  liquid reactants  may  be  allowed  to  react  to  a  certain  extent  (sometimes  termed degree  of ripening).

## 1.21 intercalation

Process by which a substance becomes transferred into pre-existing spaces of molecular dimensions in a second substance.

Note: The term as defined here is specific to polymer science. An alternative definition of 'intercalation' applies in some other fields of chemistry [3].

## 1.22 exfoliation

Process by which the layers of a multi-layered structure separate.

Note: In the context of a nanocomposite material, the individual layers are of the order of at most a few nanometers in thickness.

## 1.23 wetting

Process  by  which  an  interface  between  a  solid  and  a  gas  is  replaced  by  an  interface between the same solid and a liquid.

## 1.24 adhesion

Holding together of two bodies by interfacial forces or mechanical interlocking on a scale of micrometers or less.

## 1.25 chemical adhesion

Adhesion in  which  two  bodies  are  held  together  at  an  interface  by  ionic  or  covalent bonding between molecules on either side of the interface.

## BLENDS, COMPOSITES, AND MULTIPHASE MATERIALS

## 1.26 interfacial adhesion

## tack

Adhesion in which interfaces between phases or components are maintained by intermolecular forces, chain entanglements, or both, across the interfaces.

Note 1: Adhesive  strength , F a,  SI  unit:  Nm -2 is  the  force  required  to  separate  one condensed phase  domain from  another  at  the  interface  between  the  two phase  domains divided by the area of the interface.

- Note 2: Interfacial tension , γ ,  unit:  Nm -1 ,  Jm -2 is  the  change  in  Gibbs  energy  per  unit change in interfacial area for substances in physical contact.
- Note 3: Use of the term interfacial energy for interfacial tension is not recommended.

## 1.27 interfacial bonding

Bonding in which the surfaces of two bodies in contact with one another are held together by intermolecular forces.

Note:  Examples  of  intermolecular  forces  include  covalent,  ionic,  van  der  Waals,  and hydrogen bonds.

## 1.28 interfacial fracture

Brittle fracture that takes place at an interface.

## 1.29 craze

Crack-like cavity formed when a polymer is stressed in tension that contains load-bearing fibrils spanning the gap between the surfaces of the cavity.

Note: Deformation of continua occurs with only minor changes in volume; hence, a craze consists of both fibrils and voids.

## 1.30 additive

Substance added to a polymer.

- Note 1: The term as defined here is specific to polymer science. An alternative definition of 'additive' applies in some other fields of chemistry [3].
- Note 2: An  additive  is  usually  a  minor  component  of  the  mixture  formed  and  usually modifies the properties of the polymer.
- Note 3: Examples of additives are antioxidants, plasticizers, flame retardants, processing aids, other polymers, colorants, UV absorbers, and extenders [7].

## 1.31 interfacial agent

Additive that reduces the interfacial energy between phase domains .

## 1.32 compatibility

Capability of the individual component substances in either an immiscible polymer blend or a polymer composite to exhibit interfacial adhesion .

Note 1: Use of the term 'compatibility' to describe miscible systems is discouraged.

Note 2: Compatibility  is  often  established  by  the  observation  of  mechanical  integrity under the intended conditions of use of a composite or an immiscible polymer blend .

## 1.33 compatibilization

Process of modification of the interfacial properties in an immiscible polymer blend that results in formation of the interphases and stabilization of the morphology, leading to the creation of a compatible polymer blend .

## TERMINOLOGY

Note:  Compatibilization  may  be  achieved  by  addition  of  suitable  copolymers  or  by chemical modification of interfaces through physical treatment (i.e., irradiation or thermal) or reactive processing.

## 1.34 degree of compatibility

Measure of the strength of the interfacial bonding between the component substances of a composite or immiscible polymer blend .

Note 1: Estimates  of  the  degree  of  compatibility  are  often  based  upon  the  mechanical performance of the composite , the interphase thickness , or the sizes of the phase domains present  in  the composite ,  relative  to  the  corresponding  properties  of composites lacking compatibility .

Note 2: The  term degree  of  incompatibility is  sometimes  used  instead  of  degree  of compatibility.  Such  use  is  discouraged  as  incompatibility  is  related  to  the  weakness  of interfacial bonding .

## 1.35 compatible polymer blend

Immiscible polymer blend that exhibits macroscopically uniform physical properties.

Note: The macroscopically uniform physical properties are usually caused by sufficiently strong interactions between the component polymers.

## 1.36 compatibilizer

Polymer  or  copolymer  that,  when  added  to  an immiscible  polymer blend,  modifies  its interfacial character and stabilizes its morphology.

Note:  Compatibilizers  usually  stabilize morphologies over  distances  of  the  order  of micrometers or less.

## 1.37 coupling agent

## adhesion promoter

Interfacial agent comprised of molecules possessing two or more functional groups, each of  which  exhibits  preferential  interactions  with  the  various  types  of phase domains in  a composite .

Note 1: A coupling agent increases adhesion between phase domains .

Note 2: An example of the use of a coupling agent is in a mineral-filled polymer material where  one  part  of  the  coupling  agent  molecule  can  chemically  bond  to  the  inorganic mineral while the other part can chemically bond to the polymer.

## 1.38 polymer alloy

Polymeric material, exhibiting macroscopically uniform physical properties throughout its whole volume, that comprises a compatible polymer blend , a miscible polymer blend , or a multiphase copolymer.

Note 1:   See note Note 5 in Definition 1.1.

Note 2: The use of the term polymer alloy for a polymer blend is discouraged.

## 1.39 dispersion

Material  comprising  more  than  one  phase  where  at  least  one  of  the  phases  consists  of finely  divided phase domains ,  often  in  the  colloidal  size  range,  distributed  throughout  a continuous phase domain .

Note 1: The term as defined here is specific to polymer science. An alternative definition of 'dispersion' applies in some other fields of chemistry [3].

## BLENDS, COMPOSITES, AND MULTIPHASE MATERIALS

Note 2: Particles in the colloidal size range have linear dimensions [3] between 1 nm and 1 µ m.

Note 3: The  finely  divided  domains  are  called  the  dispersed  or discontinuous  phase domains .

Note 4: For a definition of continuous phase domain see 3.12.

Note 5: A  dispersion  is  often  further  characterized  on  the  basis  of  the  size  of  the continuous  phase  domains as a macrodispersion or a microdispersion .  To  avoid ambiguity when using these terms, the size of the domain should also be defined.

## 1.40 dispersing agent dispersing aid dispersant

Additive ,  exhibiting  surface  activity,  that  is  added  to  a  suspending  medium  to  promote uniform and maximum separation of extremely fine solid particles, often of colloidal size (see Note 2 in Definition 1.39)

Note: Although dispersing agents achieve results similar to compatibilizers , they function differently  in  that  they  reduce  the  attractive  forces  between  fine  particles,  which  allows them to be more easily separated and dispersed.

## 1.41 agglomeration

## aggregation

Process in which dispersed molecules or particles assemble rather than remain as isolated single molecules or particles [3].

## 1.42

## agglomerate aggregate

Cluster of molecules or particles that results from agglomeration .

Note: The term as defined here is specific to polymer science. An alternative definition of 'aggregate' is used in some other fields of chemistry [3] (see also Chapter 11).

## 1.43 extender

Substance,  especially  a  diluent  or  modifier,  added  to  a  polymer  to  increase  its  volume without substantially altering the desirable properties of the polymer.

Note:   An extender may be a liquid or a solid.

## 1.44 filler

Solid extender .

Note 1: The term as defined here is specific to polymer science. An alternative definition of 'filler' applies in some other fields of chemistry [3].

Note 2: Fillers may  be added to modify mechanical, optical, electrical, thermal, flammability properties, or simply to serve as extenders .

## 1.45 fill factor , φ fill

Maximum volume fraction  of  a  particulate filler that  can  be  added  to  a  polymer  while maintaining the polymer as the continuous phase domains .

## TERMINOLOGY

## 1.46 thermoplastic elastomer

Either

Melt-processable polymer  blend or  copolymer  in  which  a  continuous  elastomeric phase domain is  reinforced  by  dispersed  hard  (glassy  or  crystalline) phase domains that  act  as junction points over a limited range of temperature.

or

Elastomer comprising a thermoreversible network.

Note 1: The behaviour of  the  hard phase  domains as  junction  points  is  thermally reversible.

Note 2: The interfacial interaction between hard and soft phase domains in a thermoplastic  elastomer  is  often  the  result  of  covalent  bonds  between  the  phases  and  is sufficient to prevent the flow of the elastomeric phase domains under conditions of use.

Note 3: Examples  of  thermoplastic  elastomers  include  block  copolymers  and  blends  of plastics and rubbers.

## 2 PHASE DOMAIN BEHAVIOR

## 2.1 miscibility window

Range of copolymer compositions in a polymer mixture, at least one component substance of which is a copolymer, that gives miscibility over a range of temperatures and pressures.

- Note 1: Outside the miscibility window immiscible mixtures are formed.
- Note 2: The  compositions  of  the  copolymers  within  the  miscibility  window  usually exclude the homopolymer compositions of the monomers from which the copolymers are prepared.
- Note 3: The miscibility window is affected by the molecular weights of the component substances.

Note 4: The  existence  of  miscibility  windows  has  been  attributed  to  an  average  force between  the  monomer  units  of  the  copolymer  that  leads  to  those  units  associating preferentially with the monomer units of the other polymers.

## 2.2 miscibility gap

Area  within  the coexistence curve  of an isobaric  phase  diagram  (temperature  vs. composition) or an isothermal phase diagram (pressure vs. composition).

Note:  A  miscibility  gap  is  observed  at  temperatures  below  an upper  critical  solution temperature (UCST) or above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Its location depends on pressure. In the miscibility gap, there are at least two phases coexisting.

## 2.3 Flory-Huggins theory

## Flory-Huggins-Staverman theory

Statistical thermodynamic mean-field theory of polymer solutions, formulated independently by Flory, Huggins, and Staverman, in which the thermodynamic quantities of the solution are derived from a simple concept of combinatorial entropy of mixing and a reduced Gibbs-energy parameter, the χ /f020interaction parameter [3].

Note 1: The  Flory-Huggins  theory  has  often  been  found  to  have  utility  for polymer blends ;  however,  there  are  many  equation-of-state  theories  that  provide  more  accurate descriptions of polymer-polymer interactions.

Note 2: The present definition has been modified from that which appears in ref. [5] to acknowledge the contributions of Staverman and to further clarify the statistical basis of the theory.

## BLENDS, COMPOSITES, AND MULTIPHASE MATERIALS

## 2.4 χ /uniF020 interaction parameter , χ

Interaction parameter, employed  in the Flory-Huggins  theory , to account for the contribution of the noncombinatorial entropy of mixing and the enthalpy of mixing to the Gibbs energy of mixing.

Note 1: The  definition  and  the  name  of  the  term  have  been  modified  from  that  which appears in ref. [5] to reflect its broader use in the context of polymer blends . In its simplest form,  the χ /uniF020parameter  is  defined  according  to  the  Flory-Huggins  equation  for  binary mixtures

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

for a mixture of amounts of substance n 1 and n 2  of  components denoted 1 and 2, giving volume  fractions φ 1  and φ 2,  with  the  molecules  of  component  1  each  conceptually consisting  of x 1  segments  whose  Gibbs  energy  of  interaction  with  segments  of  equal volume in the molecules of component 2 is characterized by the interaction parameter χ .

Note 2: The χ /uniF020interaction parameters characterizing a given system vary with composition, molar mass, and temperature.

Note 3: B is an alternative parameter to χ , where B = χ RT/V m, in which V m is the molar volume of one of the components of the mixture.

## 2.5 nucleation of phase separation

Initiation of phase domains formation through the presence of heterogeneities [3]. Note: In a metastable region of a phase diagram (see Definition 1.2), phase separation is initiated only by nucleation.

## 2.6 binodal binodal curve

## coexistence curve

Curve defining the region of composition and temperature in a phase diagram for a binary mixture across which a transition occurs from miscibility of the components to conditions where single-phase mixtures are metastable or unstable (see Note 4 in Definition 1.2).

Note: Binodal compositions are defined by pairs of points on the curve of Gibbs energy of mixing  vs.  composition  that  have  common  tangents,  corresponding  to  compositions  of equal chemical potentials of each of the two components in two phases.

## 2.7 spinodal

## spinodal curve

Curve  defining  the  region  of  composition  and  temperature  for  a  binary  mixture  across which a transition occurs from conditions where single-phase mixtures are metastable to conditions  where  single-phase  mixtures  are  unstable  and  undergo  phase  separation  by spinodal decomposition .

Note 1: The spinodal curve for a binary mixture is defined as the geometrical locus of all states with

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note 2: In the unstable region bounded by the spinodal curve, phase domains separation is spontaneous, i.e., no nucleation step is required to initiate the separation process.

## 2.8 spinodal decomposition

## spinodal phase-demixing

Long-range, diffusion-limited, spontaneous phase domains separation initiated by delocalized  concentration  fluctuations  occurring  in  an  unstable  region  of  a  mixture bounded by a spinodal curve .

Note: Spinodal  decomposition  occurs  when  the  magnitude  of  Gibbs  energy  fluctuations with respect to composition are zero.

## 2.9 cloud point

Experimentally  measured  point  in  the  phase  diagram  of  a  mixture  at  which  a  loss  in transparency is observed due to light scattering caused by a transition from a single- to a two-phase state.

Note 1: The  phenomenon  is  characterized  by  the  first appearance  of turbidity or cloudiness.

Note 2: A cloud point is heating rate- or cooling rate-dependent.

## 2.10 cloud-point curve

Curve  of  temperature  vs.  composition  defined  by  the cloud  points over  range  of compositions of two substances.

Note:  Mixtures  are  observed  to  undergo  a  transition  from  a  single-  to  a  two-phase  state upon heating or cooling.

## 2.11 cloud-point temperature

Temperature at a cloud point .

## 2.12 critical point

Point  in  the  isobaric  temperature-composition  plane  for  a  binary  mixture  where  the compositions of all coexisting phases become identical.

Note 1: An alternative definition of 'critical solution point' refers strictly to liquid-vapor equilibria [3].

Note 2: Unless specified atmospheric pressure is assumed.

- Note 3: In a phase diagram, the slope of the tangent to the spinodal is zero at this point.
- Note 4: At a critical point, binodals and spinodal s coincide.

Note 5: Although the definition holds strictly for binary mixtures, it is often erroneously applied to multicomponent mixtures.

Note 6: See note 3 in Definition 1.2.

## 2.13 lower critical solution temperature , ( LCST )

Critical temperature below which a mixture is miscible [3].

Note 1: Below the LCST and above the upper critical solution temperature (UCST), if it exists, a single phase exists for all compositions.

Note 2: The  LCST  depends  upon  pressure  and  the  molar-mass  distributions  of  the constituent polymer(s).

Note 3: For a mixture containing or consisting of polymeric components, these may be different polymers or species of different molar mass of the same polymer.

## BLENDS, COMPOSITES, AND MULTIPHASE MATERIALS

## 2.14 upper critical solution temperature , ( UCST )

Critical temperature above which a mixture is miscible [3].

Note 1: Above the UCST and below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), if it exists, a single phase exists for all compositions

Note 2: The  UCST  depends  upon  the  pressure  and  molar-mass  distributions  of  the constituent polymer(s).

Note 3: For a mixture containing or consisting of polymeric components, these may be different polymers or species of different molar mass of the same polymer.

## 2.15 phase inversion

Process  by  which  an  initially continuous phase  domain becomes  the dispersed phase domain and the initially dispersed phase domain becomes the continuous phase domains [3].

Note 1: Phase inversion may be observed during the polymerization or melt processing of polymer blend systems.

Note 2: The  phenomenon  is  usually  observed  during  polymerization  of  a  monomer containing a dissolved polymer.

## 2.16 interdiffusion

Process  by  which  homogeneity  in  a  mixture  is  approached  by  means  of  spontaneous mutual molecular diffusion.

## 2.17 blooming

Process in which one component of a polymer mixture, usually not a polymer, undergoes phase separation and migration to an external surface of the mixture.

## 2.18 coalescence

Process in which two phase domains of  essentially identical composition in contact with one another form a larger phase domain [3].

Note 1: Coalescence reduces the total interfacial area.

Note 2: The flocculation of a polymer colloid, through the formation of aggregates , may be followed by coalescence.

## 2.19 morphology coarsening phase ripening

Process by which phase domains increase in size during the aging of a multiphase material.

Note 1: In the coarsening at the late stage of phase separation, volumes and compositions of phase domains are conserved.

Note 2: Representative mechanisms for coarsening at the late stage of phase separation are:  (1)  material  flow  in  domains  driven  by interfacial  tension (observed  in  a  cocontinuous  morphology),  (2)  the  growth  of  domain  size  by  evaporation  from  smaller droplets and condensation into larger droplets, and (3) coalescence (fusion) of more than two  droplets.  The  mechanisms  are  usually  called  (1)  Siggia's  mechanism,  (2)  Ostwald ripening (or the Lifshitz-Slyozov mechanism), and (3) coalescence .

Note 3: Morphology coarsening can be substantially stopped by, for example, vitrification,  crosslinking,  and pinning ,  the  slowing  down  of  molecular  diffusion  across domain interfaces .

## 3 DOMAINS AND MORPHOLOGIES

Many types of morphologies have been reported in the literature of multiphase polymeric materials. It is the intent of this document to define only the most commonly used terms. In addition, some morphologies have historically been described by very imprecise terms that may not have universal meanings. However, if such terms are widely used they are defined here.

## 3.1 morphology

Shape, optical appearance, or form of phase domains in substances, such as high polymers, polymer blends , composites , and crystals.

Note:  For  a polymer  blend or composite ,  the  morphology  describes  the  structures  and shapes  observed,  often  by  microscopy  or  scattering  techniques,  of  the  different phase domains present within the mixture.

## 3.2 phase domain

Region of a material that is uniform in chemical composition and physical state.

- Note 1: A phase in a multiphase material can form domains differing in size.
- Note 2: The term 'domain' may be qualified by the adjective microscopic or nanoscopic or the prefix micro- or nano- according to the size of the linear dimensions of the domain.

Note 3: The prefixes micro-, and nano- are frequently incorrectly used to qualify the term 'phase'  instead  of  the  term  'domain';  hence,  'microphase  domain',  and  'nanophase domain' are often used. The correct terminology that should be used is phase microdomain and phase nanodomain .

## 3.3 multiphase copolymer

Copolymer comprising phase-separated domains.

## 3.4 domain interface

## domain boundary

Surface forming a boundary between two phase domains .

Note: A representation of the domain interface as a two-dimensional surface oversimplifies the  actual  structure.  All  interfaces  have  a  third  dimension,  namely,  the interphase or interfacial region .

## 3.5 domain structure

Morphology of individual phase domain s in a multiphase system.

Note:  Domain  structures  may  be  described  for phase  domains or  domains  that  are themselves multiphase structures.

## 3.6 interfacial region interphase

Region  between phase  domains in  an immiscible polymer  blend in  which  a  gradient  in composition exists [3].

## 3.7 phase interaction

Molecular interaction between the components present in the interphases of a multiphase mixture.

Note: The interphase elasticity is the capability of a deformed interphase to return to its original dimensions after the force causing the deformation has been removed.

## BLENDS, COMPOSITES, AND MULTIPHASE MATERIALS

## 3.8 interfacial-region thickness interphase thickness interfacial width

Linear extent of the composition gradient in an interfacial region [3].

Note: The width at half  the  maximum  of  the  composition  profile  across  the interfacial region or  the  distance  between  locations  where  d φ /d r (with φ /uniF020  the  composition  of  a component and r the distance through the interfacial region ) has decreased to 1/e are used as measures of the interfacial-region thickness.

## 3.9 hard-segment phase domain

Phase  domain of  microscopic  or  smaller  size,  usually  in  a  block,  graft,  or segmented copolymer , comprising essentially those segments of the polymer that are rigid and capable of forming strong intermolecular interactions.

Note: Hard-segment phase domains are typically of 2-15 nm linear size.

## 3.10 soft-segment phase domain

Phase  domain of  microscopic  or  smaller  size,  usually  in  a  block,  graft,  or segmented copolymer , comprising essentially those segments of the polymer that have glass transition temperatures lower than the temperature of use.

Note: Soft-segment phase domains are often larger than hard-segment phase domains and are often continuous.

## 3.11 segmented copolymer

Copolymer  containing phase  domains of  microscopic  or  smaller  size,  with  the  domains constituted principally of single types of constitutional unit.

Note:  The  types  of  domain  in  a  segmented  copolymer  usually  comprise hardand softsegment phase domains .

## 3.12 continuous phase domain

## matrix phase domain

Phase domain consisting  of  a  single  phase  in  a  heterogeneous  mixture  through  which  a continuous path to all phase domain boundaries may be drawn without crossing a phase domain boundary.

Note: In a polymer blend , the continuous phase domain is sometimes referred to as the host polymer , bulk substance , or matrix .

## 3.13 discontinuous phase domain discrete phase domain dispersed phase domain

Phase domain in  a  phase-separated mixture that is surrounded by a continuous phase but isolated from all other similar phase domains within the mixture.

Note: The discontinuous phase domain is sometimes referred to as the guest polymer.

## 3.14 dual phase domain continuity co-continuous phase domains

Topological condition, in a phase-separated, two-component mixture, in which a continuous  path  through  either phase  domain may  be  drawn  to  all phase  domain boundaries without crossing any phase domain boundary.

## 3.15 core-shell morphology

Two-phase  domain morphology , of approximately  spherical  shape,  comprising  two polymers,  each  in  separate phase  domains ,  in  which phase  domains of  one  polymer completely encapsulate the phase domains of the other polymer.

Note: This morphology is most commonly observed in copolymers or blends prepared in emulsion  polymerization  by  the  sequential  addition  and  polymerization  of  two  different monomer compositions.

## 3.16 cylindrical morphology

Phase  domain morphology ,  usually  comprising  two  polymers,  each  in  separate phase domains , in which the phase domains of one polymer are of cylindrical shape.

Note 1: Phase domains of the constituent polymers may alternate, which results in many cylindrical layers surrounding a central core domain.

Note 2: Cylindrical morphologies can be observed, for example, in triblock copolymers.

## 3.17 fibrillar morphology

Morphology in which phase domains have shapes with one dimension much larger than the other two dimensions.

## 3.18 lamellar domain morphology

Morphology in  which phase domains have shapes with two dimensions much larger than the third dimension.

Note:  Plate-like phase  domains have  the  appearance  of  extended  planes  that  are  often oriented essentially parallel to one another.

## 3.19 microdomain morphology

Morphology consisting of phase microdomains.

Note 1: See Defintion 3.2 .

Note 2: Microdomain morphologies are  usually observed in block, graft, and segmented copolymers .

Note 3: The  type  of morphology observed  depends  upon  the  relative  abundance  of  the different  types  of  constitutional  units  and  the  conditions  for  the  generation  of  the morphology .  The  most  commonly  observed morphologies are  spheres,  cylinders,  and lamellae.

## 3.20 nanodomain morphology

Morphology consisting of phase nanodomains.

Note:  See Defintion 3.2 .

## 3.21 onion morphology

Multiphase morphology of  roughly  spherical  shape  that  comprises  alternating  layers  of different polymers arranged concentrically, all layers being of similar thickness.

## 3.22 ordered co-continuous double gyroid morphology

Co-continuous morphology in  which a set of two gyroid-based phase domains exhibits a highly regular, three-dimensional lattice-like morphology with Ia3d space group symmetry.

Note 1: The  domains  are  composed  of  tripoidal  units  as  the  fundamental  building structures.

Note 2: The two domains are interlaced.

## BLENDS, COMPOSITES, AND MULTIPHASE MATERIALS

## 3.23 multicoat morphology

Morphology observed in a blend of a block copolymer with the homopolymer of one of the blocks  and  characterized  by  alternating  concentric  shells  of  the  copolymer  and  the homopolymer.

Note: The morphology is identical to onion morphology within a matrix of homopolymer [6].

## 3.24 rod-like morphology

Morphology characterized by cylindrical phase domains .

## 3.25 multiple inclusion morphology

## salami-like morphology

Multiphase morphology in  which  dispersed phase  domains of  one  polymer  contain  and completely encapsulate many phase domains of a second polymer that may have the same composition as the continuous phase domain .
